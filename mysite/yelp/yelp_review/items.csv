"My friend bought me a trip to Mexico as last minute kind offer. My passport has been expired and I needed one asap. The agency states that you need an appointment with your confirmation number. I couldn't make one in time bc I was traveling in 2 days. I probably called the automated system to check for any appointments that canceled like 30 times from Saturday night to Monday 5am. I had no choice and  I waited until Monday morning and drove 5am to Chicago from Milwaukee.  Waited until 815AM to line up outside their office. ,There was about 7 people infront of me. But I was the 2nd person they serviced bc I came ready and prepared. I didn't have any questions bc I had read the website like 10 times to double check for anything I might have left out. , My biggest advice is be nervous because they can tell you to come back another day if you are not traveling with in 24 hours and not organized with your already purchased confirmation papers. Have your application filled out with all the requirements and be polite. It should go smoothly.  Arrive early!!!! The line gets packed fast. ,Read instructions online 5 times so you are not asking them the same questions the first guy asked. It slows down the process. Everything is self explainitory on the government website. Especially if you dont have an appointment arrive early and have your paperwork ready, filled and organized.  Meaning its not in your bag. Have it out and ready. ,If you are getting a new passport your fees will be 195.00.,If you are renewing it'll cost 170.00. ,If you are not sure if you are renewing or buying a new one, fill out both applications and have them ready and double check with the two agents who will be coming around to ask you when you line up at 815AM. , If your passport  exceeds over 15 years old from the issued date then you need to fill out the NEW passport application and pay the fee of 195.00. ,Expect to spend the whole day in Chicago. I waited 6 hours but I got mines on the same day. Thank you Chicago Agency for helping people who need same day passport traveling with in 24 hours. You saved me! Idk how else to put it, arrive early, follow instructions,  have everything ready. I think it is smoother than DMV bc the agents are answering questions, prepping you in hallway so when your number is called everything is done and good to go."
"Awesome park, except for all those Red Sox fans....,Juuuust kidding! The Sox fans were awesome, and their ballpark is definitely one of the best in the league. Loved my mid-April visit."
"**Review of a same-day Passport turnaround**,I'll get into the details further below, but here are the main things to realize:,1: Everyone who gave this Agency 5 stars must be getting bribed. (I kid of course...but I'm so confused by those ratings.),2: DO NOT make an appointment, it isn't necessary.,3: IF you need a same-day Passport processed, expect to wait until at least 3:30pm (regardless of how early you arrive).,4: There is a very convenient parking lot on Federal.,5: Likewise, there is a very convenient McD a block away, that will let you camp out all day. ,6: Most of the employees here are really nice and helpful (the only reason I gave the Agency two stars instead of one).,The Details:,Three weeks before traveling internationally, I realized that my passport was in the ""expiration phase"" - meaning it wasn't expired, but it was less than 6 months from expired, which may as well be expired - what a goofy rule...,I digress. ,So, I called and found out that the only way for me to get this done, was to make an appointment. Naturally, there wasn't an appointment available for nearly three weeks - which meant I was waiting in line at the Chicago Passport Agency with a Friday morning appointment, and traveling on Monday.,When I arrived, I quickly discovered that having an appointment does NOTHING for prioritization. I stood in the same line as those that showed up the day-of, was ushered to the same room, and actually had to wait LONGER, than those without appointments. Because mine was now a same-day turnaround, I had to wait the entire day for my passport to be processed, because I now needed it on the same day. But the joke is - IF I had just arrived the day that I realized there was a problem (three weeks prior), I wouldn't have had to wait until the end of the day for my passport to be turned around on the same day! It could have just been mailed.,An even ""funnier"" joke, was that my appointment was early (which I thought meant I'd get out earlier) but what it really meant was, I was in and out of the ""processing/ordering"" part of the day, and then had to wait from 11-3pm in a McDonald's while the passport was developed. At 3pm, you are ushered upstairs for a lottery system, in which random numbers are called, and you then receive your passport. No matter that I was one of the first 10 people in line waiting for my passport - I still had to wait 45 minutes for my number to be called (while other numbers were called, re-used, and called again, as I just sat there). ,Long story short - don't make an appointment, and be prepared to be frustrated. No surprise there. Thankfully misery loves company, so the majority of the people there share your frustrations and can do nothing but laugh."
"There's probably not a lot more I can say about this great stadium that hasn't already been said.  It's iconic, well preserved and they have made great strides in the years I've been going to Fenway to make it more user friendly and have added seats while keeping the integrity of the place intact.  If you love baseball, or even if you are just interested in Americana, then you will enjoy this place.  And on a warm day with cold beer and a bunch of men playing a game they love, it's a great way to spend some time.,A few suggestions to make your day more fun and easier:  Take the T.  Park away from the stadium if you drive at all and take the subway into Kenmore Square.  It's so much better than paying $90 for parking around the stadium and dealing with all the hassle of the cars and foot traffic surrounding the game.,Also, I've found that the seats in the Field Boxes on both the 1st baseline and 3rd baseline are the best for seeing the game.  If you can get into the short rows, those are nice two because you aren't constantly being walked over or walking over people to get out of the seats.  The views there are great.  A little more expensive, but I believe it's worth it.,Oh, and have a Fenway Frank.  They are actually really tasty for a hot dog.  And beer.  I'm still searching for the fastest line for beer in the stadium, so if you have any insider knowledge on that, lemme know."
"Insanely beautiful. You'll understand the $18 admission fee once you've seen the villa and the grounds. We spent two hours here and could have spent more. Dress nicely and get yourself a few new profile pics ;) Don't forget to dream and imagine what life would have been like here...,There was a wedding being set up so we missed out on some great areas/views of the house and gardens. Some sections were also closed. Still tons to do."
"I love it this place is ,Deep  clean ,And I loved,D taking pictures in this place  ,I visited for the cherry blossom and I love it ,Safe place"
"As you can see I don't really write reviews but the reviews here really helped me so I thought I'd add one myself.,I just moved to NYC (temporarily staying in Queens until I find a place in HK), recently got hired and I needed to provide my Social Security card prior to training, which begins in 7 days in Houston. The closest Social Security office is not too far from where I'm staying but all the reviews here for that Queens office were horrible and said to go to the Manhattan office instead. So I decided on that, even though the commute would take me twice as long.,In preparation, I filled out the application online and had it sent to the FedEx that is across the street from this office to have it printed. Unfortunately, this FedEx isn't 24 hours like the many others and didn't open till 7AM next day and wasn't available for pick up till 8AM. I wanted to get to the SS office right at 7AM, when they opened, to avoid any lines. Oh well...,So today, I get to FedEx at 8AM, quickly pick up my application, cross the street (it's directly across the office building) walk into the building and get directed to the elevator to the office. No security lines or anything. Just a quick check in at the front desk to state your business. That was nice (compared to the Passport Agency that I had to deal with 2 week's ago where the security line is ridiculous).,I get upstairs and grab a number. The security officer was extremely friendly and helpful to everyone. I see there are about 10-15 people waiting so I'm assuming a 30min - 1hr wait. I sit down for 5 minutes and my number gets called right away. Seriously?! I go to the window with my app, passport and ID and the agent was extremely friendly (borderline flirtatious). I was done at the window in about 7 minutes (3 of those was her just asking personal questions about me and chit chatting). So I was pretty much in this office for only 12 minutes total; quick in and out. I guess it didn't matter that I got there later than opening to avoid lines.,For such a huge, populated city, I have never been more impressed with a government agency before (and I use to live in DC and San Diego). Definitely go here! Everyone is friendly, helpful and the process goes quickly if you have all the documents needed.,Why can't DMV be like this?!? =)"
"# To the Budget Traveler: This is completely FREE. Go and check it out, you won't regret it. Park at the Galleria mall. Parking is FREE.,# To the Adventurous Traveler: Go across the lawn to the Williams Tower. Don't act like a tourist and go up to see the sights. I got lucky on the 56th floor. Nobody bothered me and let me go right up to the windows to check out the magnificent view.,PROs: The water wall is very close to the Galleria mall and to Williams tower, so that you can enjoy multiple locations.,CONs: There isn't much directly around the water wall except residential buildings."
The 1-877 Passport Agency number I called was less than helpful. I spoke with them 6 times before I read the previous posts on expediting passports at the Chicago Office. Not one time did they mention I could go to the Chicago Passport Agency with my travel itinerary that showed travel within 24 hours  and get an expedited passport. They led me to believe I was screwed and would need to wait for an appointment. Not so. Araya K. and Rachael Z. have the best advice. Be prepared. They are a fairly efficient agency if you have all your paperwork in order and are ready to go. Plan to wait around Chicago until 3pm however. Be patient. Bring something to do or read.
"I have been to so many MLB stadiums and I'm talking the classics, Wrigley, Old Yankee, Old Comisky, Candlestick, Sky Dome, and even my fave team the Twins' Target Field. But none of those stadiums come anywhere close to the feel and the fun of Fenway.. I had dreams of seeing the Green Monster in person as a kid and when I was 12 years old My pops and I went to Fenway for the the first time! It was a life altering experience. ,It's so small, but still so big in it's history and excitement! ,I have been numerous times since, and wether you are walking around the stadium, or inside you feel the presence of all the greats who have played on that field! ,It's still easy to imagine Ted Williams coming to the plate and putting one over the low right field wall into the stands! ,So many memories here, I saw my all time fave Kent Hrbek hit a homer off Roger Clemons, I smelled Weed for the first time with my dad hanging out after a game waiting for the Twins to emerge from the ball park. I got to bake in the summer sun with my wife on a family trip as she wore a Ted Williams Jersey! It's magical baseball fun and I hope to get to bring my son there someday! It's still my fave and probably always will be! They don't make them like they used too!"
"This garden brings you back in time.,Outstanding views, perfect architecture, flawless landscape, and timeless art. ,The cafe is convenient and has one of the best cheeseburgers in town, awesome for travelers.,This is a must see in Miami!"
"With a fitting tribute to one of the country's greatest founding fathers, this is a wonderful stretch in the heart of Washington's tidal basin.,Monument history area downstairs was quite fascinating. Peaceful and serene atmosphere while smaller crowds observe with beautiful and scenic views.,Bathrooms stand at this memorial that is extremely convenient.,Less to see compared to other surrounding buildings but definitely worth the extra mile as this will always be a meaningful memorial."
"I honestly don't write Yelp reviews often, so imagine my surprise to take the time to write about a social security office. I went in there expecting to wait a few hours- brought a novel, a Rubik's cube I can't solve, and a magazine in preparation. ,In reality, I walked into the office, filled out a quick online pre registration form, and a piece of paperwork. Immediately got my number called, and went to the counter. The woman hello me was funny, nice, and fast (although not a huge fan of Millennials... I digress). Was done in 6 minutes or so. ,Reaction was kinda like those new time warner cable ads- I imagined having to take the whole day off, when it actually took a whopping 10 minutes from entering to exiting the building. ,Long story short, one happy millennial."
"I am not so sure what to make of this place, but it's great. ,Imagine several (3?) stories tall of water right in front of you. It is way cool. Apparently this is also where everyone takes photos, so there will likely be a million photographers with clients there. Or, if you're lucky like I was, a guy with a selfie stick and a tripod likely taking pics for his Tinder profile. Swipe right, ladies or gentlemen...he went to the waterwall. ,ANYWAY, this is a good place to see if you've never been before, I think, because I had never been and am glad I went! It is not super huge, just tall, so it's not a super long experience here, but it is really cool! It's lovely and powerful and surrounded by GIANT buildings and a nice grassy area--truly a nice spectacle in the area."
"It would have been fine except for Latoya. I followed all the instructions properly to renew my Husband's passport, but Latoya apparently can't handle anything out of the ordinary and had the audacity to blame me for the miscommunication between her and co-worker and insulted me in front of everyone standing in line. Obviously for a person who needs to go go to a passport agency for expedited service, they are going to be in a tense situation, but Latoya does absolutely nothing to help.  Talk about a temper."
"Recently started watching the games up in the EMC club thanks to my firm's perks. Gotta say, it gives a whole new appreciation of Fenway park!!"
"Standing at Biscayne Bay, I looked out toward the 'Italian Barge', the 158' long stone folly sculpted in 1917-19 by Alexander Stirling Calder.  This decaying ghost ship seems a harbinger of Miami's future in an era of climate change.  Designed to function as a massive breakwater against the bay's waves, it is now helpless against the slow storm of already rising sea levels that are only accelerating.,Tidal and groundwater leakage have damaged the stucco finish of the ornate swimming pool here so it's currently being restored.  Considering that saltwater intrusion is already happening in coastal south Florida, can Vizcaya truly protect itself?,Vizcaya is an achingly beautiful place.  The house and gardens are blessed with an abundant sky and comforting breezes from the bay.  However, as I walk back in time through the dark, musty rooms of the house and garden remains of James Deering's once expansive estate, this tranquil paradise unnerves me as being in the calm before the storm."
"Headquarters.,It doesn't matter where I am in Los Angeles... the Central Library is my regular destination. My imagination gets to run rampant among their racks.,Thanks to the central library, my appetite for mystery, my curiosity for Mysticism, and my interest in graphic novels are all met upon demand. I can't get enough. The children's library is a dream for adults and little ones alike, with books to open their minds, and my own.,My love of books and reading has been reawakened thanks to this place. They also have excellent FREE workshops, and free Tai Chi every Saturday. I've had free Bibimbap here as well. And of course, the free wifi is strong, and the computer lab is my office... until I get an office of my own! ,I love you, Central Library!"
"43 was such an amazing installation. This was my first experience at PR, but I loved everything about it! I was there on opening day and it was well coordinated and well supported. They expanded their usual art installation to include a commerce component and Ella Russell of Edubalicious Treats used the space as a pop up shop. It was amazing. From beginning to end the experience was positive and powerful. So many people came together for art and food and enjoyed the experience. Support this organization. It's worth it."
"1. Where is the site? ,Washington, DC,2. Is there a fee? ,No,3. Who is the site for? ,President Thomas Jefferson,4. What makes up the site (is it a single monument? A park? A historic building?)  ,consisted of a half-circle memorial situated next to a circular basin, and a statue of Thomas Jefferson inside the building.,5. When did you go? ,April, 2016,6. Why did you give it the rating you did?,The site is located in the heart of Washington's tidal basin. Combining History and Nature is what captivates me about this site. The reflection of the memorial on the water, especially when it's the peak of the cherry blossoms."
"the building is hard to miss the front desk and security are very nice. the elevator must be ancient takes awhile to come down n go up. ,there were two security guard one was very helpful the other one had a attitude. refused to get up to help patrons instead yelling at them from the desk.  I must have disturbed him from his private phone call to get a rude responds. ,when i got # i sat down for less than 5mins and proceeded to the window. its was hard to hear what the clerk was asking. they need a better way in calling out these #s either make use of the tv screens. ,very satisfied finished in less than 10 mins."
"I'm glad my family indulges me in my crazy adventures, sometimes I take them to cool places sometimes not so much. I had read about the Waterwall in Houston and had to see it for myself so I dragged my family along for the ride.,Williams Waterwall, or as I called it The Water Wall, is located in the Uptown area of Houston, it's pretty simple to get it and there is a public parking garage nearby to park at, even a few parking meters nearby., It's at the end of a nice grassy area big enough for picnics, and just laying around. The building itself is impressive even from afar.  ,You come to the Waterwall to stare at this wonder, and to take pictures.  It's very loud by the water wall, and you might get sprayed on, but you look around and see everyone is just there enjoying it. We took some pictures, I even help others with group/selfie pics. ,The family had smiles so they enjoyed it too, next time I'll have to drag them out at night to check it out, heard its super cool looking in the dark.,The Waterwall was fun, glad I found it, now it's on to the next adventure."
"Very organized.  Staff was pleasant and helpful.  AND, most importantly, my passport application was expedited (at quite a price) and I received my passport in time to take my trip abroad."
"Unfortunately coming to Boston in November means baseball season is over. While I wasn't able to catch a game in the green monster I was able to take the official tour.  Let me tel you it was amazing! Well worth the stop! ,Even with the cold and slight rain, this tour was a favorite! Our guide was great, full of insider information and history! This is really a Boston staple and her passion was intoxicating! The story of the team was remarkable, rivalry with the Yankees, the struggles and the success! ,I was shocked to be able to sit in original seats! See one of the few score boards changed by hands and the famous green wall! ,A must stop!"
"Party in the city where the heat is on.,All night on the beach til the break of dawn,Welcome to Miami (bienvenido a Miami),But in the middle of all the partying, there lies Vizcaya Museum and Gardens.  It's a beautiful hidden gem (and for geeks like me, it's a paradise).  ,Vizcaya Museum and Gardens was previously known as Villa Vizcaya.  The property previously belonged to James Deering (of Deering McCormick - International Harvester) and also located in the beautiful Coconut Grove area of Miami.,The museum (or the actual house itself) is beautiful and sadly, no pictures allowed on the inside.  On the bright side, pictures are allowed in the Gardens and on the day of the visit, my friend and I saw several weddings and quinceaneras.  ,There was an old payphone and phonebook near the entrance of the museum, and of course, one of the quinceanera's family asked her to take a picture in front of the payphone.  What's a payphone?  What's a phonebook?  It was a funny sight to see.,Worth a trip if you're into museums and picture taking in the gardens.  ENJOY!"
"It's amazing that I've never visited this library despite the fact that I'm from this area. ,Definitely not your typical library. It has multiple levels broken down based in economics, genealogy, science/technology and etc. ,It has plenty of tables and a couple study rooms. They only have wifi on certain floors so be aware of that. However they have a computer lab and you're also able to check out laptops for a maximum of two hours. ,All in all a great place to explore. The plus side is that there's also a mini park by one of the exits and the library bar is short walk from there. ,Great place to go with someone."
"Now, in the midst of celebrating its 20th anniversary, Project Row Houses has just opened Art Round 40 - Monuments: Right Beyond the Site, featuring Otabenga Jones & Associates. It's highlighting some of the history of Third Ward through the art houses. PRH not only offers community-based public art, but also has at education for youth, a young mothers program, and residential housing complexes (Row House CDC)."
"Being a first time visitor to The Emerald City, how can I complete my Seattle touring without making to the city's most significant & historic landmark, The Space Needle?! Yes, I did make it. Came here along with the Hubby on a Weekday (14th April, Thursday evening), so can say we were lucky in not getting lost in the excited crowd. ,We went up till the observation deck at 520 feet, enjoyed 360 degree panoramic viewing of the city's green and blue glory beneath it. Views were good, honestly, have been to multiple high points that I don't feel great enough to boast off anymore, but at the same time the sighting was picturesque and the experience was decent overall.,What impressed me more? ,Gotta admit that the Space Needle is up-to-date with it's latest photo-taking attractions compared to other observatory towers wherever I've been to in the U.S. It has every option possible and the good news is, it's all included in the ticket fare already, no extra charge. What's even more relieving is that you need not wait for them to email you separately, you can easily get them transferred from any one of the kiosks at the observation deck. When is the picture clicked? When you enter inside the space needle at the lower level before taking the elevator, you'l be asked to pose for 1 picture. Another photo attraction is the 'Selfie camera' at the outdoor section of the deck. Pose well and quickly. Again, it's an easy transfer to emails through kiosks.,Other Digital attractions,- Panocam touch screen displays, showing you best views of the city, of the day you visit.,- You get acknowledged in their Visitor list/ guest book. This is done by adding your name and the city from where you came from, that's it, now you got added to their history!!! Hurray!!!,Helpful Tips,,- Need to charge your mobiles? No worries, there are plenty of charging stations at the observation deck.,- Two concession stands, Deck SkyCafe. (Although I din't try purchasing any snack/drink),Tickets - since we were interested to explore the Chihuly Garden and Glass nearby, we got their best value deal (two experiences for one price) for $36 per person.,From our experience, Weekdays are the best I suppose. It just took us around half an hour to complete our touring at the observation deck. Also, don't forget to sneak peek at their huge selection gift shop at the bottom most level."
"Absolutely gorgeous at night! The memorial itself isn't as grand as the Lincoln Memorial but the night time view is fantastic. There are also restrooms downstairs, with an exhibit on Jefferson's life and contributions. There is also a gift shop if you're a true Jeffersonphile. ,The biggest struggle with the Jefferson Memorial is how far away it is from all the other memorials. I'd recommend coming by car rather than attempting to walk it."
"Review based on several factors:,1.) Is this tunnel in fact a tunnel? Yes, 5 Stars,2.) Is this tunnel in or near Baltimore? Yes, 5 Stars,3.) Is this tunnel on or near the Harbor in Baltimore? Yes, 5 Stars,4.) Is this tunnel, a tunnel on both sides? Yes, 5 Stars,5.) Can I drive my vehicle INTO this tunnel? Yes, 5 stars,6.) Can I drive my vehicle  Out of this tunnel? Yes, 5 Stars,7.) Does this tunnel consistently provide safe passage? Yes, 5 Stars,8.) Is this tunnel readily available when I Need it? Yes, 5 Stars,9.) Is this tunnel well lit? Yes, 5 Stars,10.) Can I hold my breath while driving completely through this tunnel? No, not anymore. 1 Star.,Overall: I am willing to stake my reputation on the fact this this tunnel, is indeed a tunnel. The age of this tunnel, and the traffic that goes through it are of no concern to me. This tunnel is tride and true, and to my knowledge has never collapsed. I have no other choice then to deem that this tunnel specifically has done a fine job, and has truly stood the test of time. It's actually one of my 2 favorite tunnels in baltimore! Well done."
In and out in less than 20 minutes. You can't beat that on a Monday.
"When a Government service office can efficiently get you in and out their office with a pleasant smile in the morning, they deserve 5-stars!,First, the office is open at 7am for the early birds. I was aiming for 7:30 but didn't arrive until 8am [sigh]. I was prepared for a crazed waiting room but there were only 25 people in queue. The helpful security guards directed me to to print my waiting ticket at the touch screen kiosk and fill out the application and the waiting game began.,The waiting room is clean and quiet. Conversations were at a minimum as it was relatively early. Note: Cell phones are not permitted at the window (how disrespectful that would be); nor pics as I attempted to take one of the waiting room and was lightly reprimanded (didn't know that tidbit). Within thirty minutes, I was serviced and out the door. TIP: It's beneficial to have ALL your paperwork filled out in advance and required documents at hand. Kudos to me. ,Now if only the US Postal system could work this effortlessly....."
"I genuinely don't know how I'm supposed to review a ""plaza"".  I mean, it's not Dealey Plaza where Kennedy got shot or anything, but it's still a cool plaza.  Was down here for the Jazz Festival, and the amphitheater was cool enough, plenty of seating both in the venue and around the area on grassy areas under trees with shade (which is nice on a still, 90 degree day), lots of space for some great vendors to setup shop, and five stages in the surrounding area.,Good times.  Definitely worth hitting concerts that take place here."
"The Williams Waterfall is just as impressive at night as it would be during the day. The scale of the construction and engineering is impressive. It does a good job of making you feel small. ,Coming on a windy day is not ideal. We had a little bit of wind when we visited and every time there was a gust we paid for it. The surrounding grassy park area was marsh like for a reason. Getting a little wet was worth it for an awe inspiring experience. ,I also survived a visit to it while having a full bladder. It can be done!"
"Saved my butt. If your flight is in the next 24 hours, they'll service you without an appointment for that day. Call to book an appointment two weeks before departure! You can't just show up with an appointment for a different day, despite what some of the other reviews say."
"The energy, the people, the experience, Fenway is more than just a baseball park.  Walking through the stadium,  I knew I was about to embark on a once in a lifetime experience.  Sure,  I have been to plenty of baseball games but never have I experienced the Green Monster (nickname)  firsthand.  From the interactive crowd singing ""Sweet Caroline""  to the history of the ""red seat""   If you ever find yourself in Boston, go and experience Fenway first hand (you won't regret it)."
"Gorgeous landmark! The gardens were beautiful. This was well worth the $16 admission fee. You can choose to do a guided walking tour or check out the place on your own. When I visited Vizcaya, three couples were taking their wedding photos here. It's a beautiful property for both kids and adults to explore."
"The civil wedding that we had there was magic!,The staff is friendly and very organized - through the application process we hardly had to wait in line. The justice that married us was a wordsmith and a highly spirited gentleman. ,It really is as good as it gets"
"I think people are overrating this library a bit as a free tourist attraction. It's very pretty and has interesting exhibits. For use as an actual LIBRARY there's a few significant shortcomings however. ,* WiFi EXTREMELY spotty. Would connect and be OK for 10 minutes then be unusable for like 20. ,* While I'm generally not a fan of the roving security guards in other places like the SF Civic Center library rousting people and such, if someone crashes out and pees their pants here, there seems to be no means of removing them. ,* Only took a cursory look at the book selection but it looked just OK at best. Lot more space devoted to touristy exhibits than to actual books. ,* Syringe wrappers all over the men's room on the first floor ... I'd look REAL carefully everywhere if you have to use the restroom here,I do appreciate the individual desks with outlets, however, and surprisingly the seating isn't jammed up despite the nation's largest homeless population being right outside ... just would be nice if the wireless actually worked and you weren't subject to random MC Pee Pants jamming up everyone's ride."
"A row of shotgun shacks turned into free art galleries by local artists? awesome. I'd heard about this place for many years, but I finally got around to visiting them recently.  The art exhibits change and the day we went, only some of the houses were open. I went into several, but the one I liked the best was the ""seven deadly sins"". It showed each of the seven deadly sins using dogs. There was a dog statue looking at itself in a mirror (vanity), a dog floating in the air about to pounce angrily on you (wrath), etc.... There were kind of cool! Some of the exhibits were kind of boring, but each exhibit was unique. ,I like that this is an alternative space to the fancy named artist spaces. This gives some local artists a place to display their art and interact with the public on opening nights. Take some time and go down to this part of town, check out the art, and explore this part of the city.,Free admission.,Open Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 5pm."
"I don't get it, what's all the hype about, yes there is nice views, but not $22-24 dollars worth. People, people, people, everywhere, you go around in a circle and it is over, after you wait in long lines to get up there, to walk pass the history which was pretty cool, but on the weekend why are elevators closed/shut down. Congestion duh! Its a popular  attraction, and I'm glad to remove it off my bucket list, but I just did not enjoy it or see what is all the hype about.  ,Now the gift shop has a lot of interesting little gifts, and what knots to purchase and a fudge shop with delicious fudge bars."
"I made it finally. What a special spot in many ways. Don't miss checking the small museum and souvenir shops underneath!,Price: Free.,Parking: Hmmmm. You should park on streets or garages around Smithsonian and walk here. I walked from the top of Arlington cemetery . It took about 1 hour. I saved money and worked out well.,Special: Many people take special shots here. Wedding, fashion, etc... On the stairs facing the Washington monument."
"1. $4 cash or EZ-pass to get through the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. I highly suggest getting EZ-pass because the cash lines can be extremely long and tiring to wait for.,2. The tunnel is brightly lit, compared to the Holland Tunnel in NY-NJ.,3. The roads are smooth and exactly how roads should be.,4. There's wifi service!"
"Thank Michael Styles and Latonya..  Courteous staff made the process of registering my car in GA the least painful. ,Update to payment options :,Credit/Debit Cards ,Cash,Personal checks ,Money Orders ,Please note : First time registers make sure your insurance company electronically downloads your insurance information on their system prior to visiting as your insurance identification card isn't enough."
"Professional service, lovely teller, smooth process."
I've been to Hart Plaza for a couple of festivals during the summer.  It's a nice space to hang out and enjoy the view of the waterfront.  The last time I was here it was cool and breezy.  I walked along the riverfront down to Hart Plaza from St. Aubin Street.  Great views overlooking Canada.
"Pretty cool park just next to Williams Tower and near the Galleria.,Big grassy area, good for a picnic, football game, reading a book, etc. ,And the waterwall is pretty cool. Fun for kids - they get a kick out of it. ,Now that it's fall, I'll probably walk over from work a couple times a week just to take a break and relax. Yay for cooler weather!,Definitely check it out! On the weekends, it's full of couples taking their wedding and engagement photos! I've heard it's the most photographed place in Houston, but don't quote me on it!"
"If you can follow instructions well, your experience will be smooth.,If you can't, it won't.  ,It's as simple as that.,Best bit of advice I can give is to research everything you need online BEFORE you come.  And bring everything you need.  If you are traveling in 2 weeks and need a passport, they will tell you to call for an appointment.  Call and get an appointment but still go in at your earliest convenience.  There were tons of people w/o appointments who needed new or renewed passports on short notice.  But make sure you have everything filled out and ready (docs, payments, etc.).  You are going to wait a bit due to the volume but without these things in hand, you will wait longer.,I applied for a passport on a Thursday and got mine the following Monday.  Of course I paid the expedited $65 dollars in addition to the regular fee but it was worth it to insure i had it in time for my trip.  Took about a hour with wait time to apply."
Our bus tour went by Fenway Park so we decided to check it out. There are some nice pubs across the street. It's an old stadium but very nice. This is a good stop.
"What a beautiful place to visit, especially on a sunny-blue-skied day!,Garden:,The gardens were beautiful, with orchids and mazes made of bushes. The views by the waters were 2nd to none. You can just feel the breeze and the endless stretches of water into the blue sky is just breath taking. ,The gardens also seemed....free? Because they didn't take our ticket until we went to the mansion so it's possible you only have to pay to go into the mansion. (Maybe technically that's not allowed but you could swing it).,Mansion:,No pictures in the mansion so you won't see much here on Yelp. The mansion itself was pretty cool. I really liked reading the history of the place and why the guy did what he did. The artifacts he left like letters and such were very interesting. Make sure you explore all the little nooks and crannies in here because he built a lot of side rooms and side floors. ,Tickets were not too bad since they were only $18 and $10 with student ID. We came on a Monday so it was discounted by $2. It was just a beautiful serene place to walk and take pictures. I saw some people taking modeling shots or sweet 16 shots here too. Obviously beautiful place. Disappointed that parts of it was closed due to construction. I'm sure it'll be even more beautiful when everything is all fixed up. ,Definitely plan to be here for 2+ hours to explore everything. There's a cafe for food and drinks to keep your tummy satisfied."
"Politics aside, City Hall itself is a great venue space.  My company had our Holiday Party here and it was a nice classic environment with the intricate architecture, the elaborate design of everything from the ceilings to the wall fixtures, and well, too many more things to describe.  Of course, with it being so wide open, it made it hard to find people.  I think I literally climbed up and down those stairs three times and I wasn't entire sober either so I was very conscious of where my feet landed because it was a looooong way down to the bottom of the stairs.,The only downside to coming here is walking through the shady from the Civic Center BART station.  I think I Uber'd in and out on the night I came in.  If you're walking to BART at night, then make sure to walk in pairs for safety."
"To Live & Dine in LA is an exhibit in the Los Angeles Central Library & is a retrospective of dining from the early days of Los Angeles dating back to 1875 w/ Don Mateo Keller's on Alameda Street which is no longer extant. As an interesting aside, there was even a section devoted to food served at Tehachapi State Prison with a sample recipe for ""Fat Soft Burrito Tacos"" hand written by a hunky, humpy prison chef who would probably know how to properly flame a piece of hot, juicy prime beef.,There are menus from Clifton's which has just undergone renovation; Nikodell on 5511 Melrose dating to 1961; Bit O' Tokyo on 314 E. 1st; Bob's Big Boy still on Riverside Dr. in Toluca Lake; Atomic Café in Little Tokyo famous for the after hours Punk Rock scene of the early 1980's where Blondie dined; Don the Beachcomber; Taix's when it was in DTLA before the construction of the Hollywood Frwy closed it down; Kelbo's ""Tiki Bar"" featuring Polynesian"" cuisine; Brown Derby on Vine. ,There was a video playing a tantalizing place for some amazing looking burgers made w/ loving care called Hawkins House of Burgers.  Better starve yourself & have a big appetite to kill one of their king sized burgers.  It may not be in the best of neighborhoods, but the siren call of this burger will make me go there.,With this great exhibit, there is an accompanying book, ""To Live & Dine in L.A. Menus & the Making of the Modern City from the Collection of the Los Angeles Public Library"" by Josh Kun. My only wish is that this exhibit had more menus from restaurants that have endured the test of time & have continued to this day such as El Cholo, Musso & Frank, Pete's, Cole's, Tam O'Shanter, Canter's, Original Pantry, Pig 'n Whistle, Formosa, Philippe, etc.  It would be interesting to have seen the possible evolution of their food from its early inception to the menus of today.  ,The Central Library is an architectural jewel.  Just going around the grounds & looking at the interior décor & architectural features convinces me that people in the early twentieth century had a sophistication that would be hard to duplicate today.  5 Yelp stars,PS    Ends November 13, 2015  So Hurry."
"I had the recent privilege of taking a tour of Project Row Houses that was led by the inimitable Troy of Khon's Wine Darts Coffee Art. If you haven't visited him at Khon's yet, do so for his excellent recommendations on everything from potables to art to what to see and do in Houston. He himself is a local gem so when he took a group of us to see Project Row Houses, I knew i was in for a treat.,Project Row Houses is an example of the sort of revitalization that is needed around Houston and urban centers all over the country. Amidst the Third Ward is a beautiful row of refurbished row houses filled with art exhibits of local artists. We visited on a Saturday afternoon with perfect weather, which made the contrast of Project Row Houses against the backdrop of urban houses even more striking. My favorite area was actually the garden in the back, which had small, brightly colored playhouses-and chickens! It felt more like Savannah than Houston. ,I hope that Project Row Houses sets a trend for how to revitalize an urban area while staying true to its roots. While it was evident what a labor of love Project Row Houses is, it highlighted the neighborhood's potential without undermining the soul and history of the neighborhood. In short, it's anti-gentrification. Project Row Houses also provides housing for single mothers who have pledged to make it through school. It's wonderful to think of kids being raised in an environment that emphasizes art, community involvement and hope.,Project Row Houses is quite an accomplishment. I can't wait to return. Grab coffee and lunch at Doshi House and spend an afternoon meandering through the houses. You're not only in for a wonderful afternoon but you're helping a great cause as well."
"Visited: 02/26/2016,We were super happy that no tickets were required to immerse ourselves in some history :D How can you pass up some history that isn't charged?!?! I know you all know what I mean :) There seems to be an admission fee for almost everything now, even a giant park has parking fees. So, for this to be completely free, we were quite happy! :) ,To think we got to visit the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution was created is amazing! The Founding Fathers were there! Even the entire government met there for a couple years while Washington D.C. was under construction. I highly recommend this visit if you'd like some history to not just Philadelphia but the U.S.A. :)"
"This place is like my jewelry collection. ,A gem on its own. ,Food sucks & portion is like kids meal deal but the ambience & view & speciality atmosphere is unmatched. I prefer the view from mid point rather than the top. ,They are 56 yo today so lots of free food & music. Made an excuse to cross the bridge on a last nice sunny of the week. ,Please keep this place vibrating & gleaming. My hometown gem!"
"I will admit that initially I didn't really find the Jefferson Memorial that much interesting to go to at all. Growing up, either from watching too much TV such as the Simpsons (episode where Lisa goes to Washington & coming across a problem, wants to tell her problems to Lincoln, has to head to Jefferson instead since the Lincoln one was packed), the Jefferson Memorial isn't really in print or mentioned much, except maybe in your elementary to middle school American History books (and even then, it's very brief to the point where you forget about it).,Well, as I rounded my way around the Tidal Basin, I finally had the chance to see it up live and personal, and the sight totally blew me away. Standing before me, was a white marble gorgeous Memorial building designed specifically for Jefferson where the architecture of it does not lose in comparison to the one where Lincoln resides. Along the circular room surrounding the white tall sitting statue of Jefferson, there are certain scripture taken from the Declaration of Independence that were contributed by Jefferson and earned him his place in history.,As I stared out into the Tidal Basin from the cool tiled white steps, sitting down and taking a breather, I noticed the beauty of the Washington Monument again throwing its ever-seeing reflection into the clear waters of the Basin, and you notice the little Tidal Basin Paddle Boat Company along the edge of the Basin; I felt a moment of serene peace an you can't help but breathe a sign of content as the breeze blows past you.,Definitely a must-see!"
Underwater Tunnel- nothing too excited except when you see yourself on a map going through it.
"Can't believe this is going to be the sixth tunnel I'm about to review!,I noticed every time driving through the tunnel there's a word above the tunnel....""bore"".... ""bore"" is a term used to describe the inner diameter of a pipe or tube.... The tunnel has 4 tubes...each tube having 2 lanes...lanes are pretty tight... Beware of late night traffics..."
"Went here today to get my plate and tags for a new car, and while it is never fun to pay for all that, the whole process was really quick and easy!,I am used to having to wait at the DMV in Atlanta for HOURS, so I went expecting that. However, there was literally no one in line. The whole process took less than 5 minutes (I went on a Tuesday at 10am). Someone mentioned it before, but make sure to bring a check or cash, they do not take credit cards or debit cards."
"The Social Security office was a bit confusing to find, but thankfully the front desk and security officers to the building were very nice and kindly directed everyone in the right direction. They must be used to seeing confused and dazed people slowly approaching their nice and shiny lobby looking for the Social Security office. Here's a tip if no one is there to reach you - down the hall to the right, take the elevator to the 3rd floor. ,Once you get off the elevator, there are 2 machines that you can use to check in to get your ticket. As if that wasn't simple enough, there are also additional security guards present to direct you and help with any questions. ,I arrived at the office shortly after 730am, there was only a small handful of people already waiting in the seating area. The seating area consisted of a row of cushioned black chairs facing 40 individual stations. Unlike other SSA offices that I have been to, each station was clearly sectioned off so that you could handle your business in private. The office was very clean and orderly, they have a strict no cell phone or eating policy. This was perhaps the best experience that I had at any government office, everyone was so cheerful and sweet. ,I was called up in exactly 12 minutes and was out of the office in less than 30 minutes. Even as I was leaving there were still only a few people behind me. A few tips for anyone anticipating a visit to the SSA office - go early and go in the middle of the week to avoid long waits and long lines. Also, come prepared with all the necessary documents - everything can be found online but if for some reason you are missing any documents they have a plethora available onsite for you to fill while you wait."
"An underutilized Detroit gem. It's basically a huge space where people can hang out, bike, skateboard, right by the riverwalk. In the summer a lot of things are happening, like festivals, I just wish they were better advertised. I would love to see some benches, some coffee shops or some food trucks around to lure people to making it a destination."
"This waterwall/waterfall is MASSIVE, LOUD and AWESOME! ,It had me in a trance-like state, Yelp.  I was zoned in.,I swear if I didn't have other shit to do, I could grab a sandwich, a beer and some board games and plant myself right in front of it all day.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.,A perfect place to be when it's hot.,The only con:  the mist from the waterfall ruins any hope of keeping a hairstyle...so put your hair up in a bun and go"
"I gotta give major props to this agency! I realized my passport expired 3 years ago........ 9 days before our trip Punta Cana. I called immediately and made an appointment  to get it renewed. I arrived at 8:15am 5 days later on my scheduled date (the doors open at 8:30). There were already over 100 people in line. Because I had an appointment, the security guard put me 6th in line. The key word is appointment! I was out of there by 8:40am and told to come back at 1:00 to get it. I arrived at 12:40pm and was able to make an earlier train back to Milwaukee. Because my passport was ready.  They are extremely organized!!,Make sure to call for an appointment, have all your forms filled out, and bring a check or credit card."
"Wow what an amazing experience!!! Thank you Fenway Park and the people of Boston.  ,I don't really follow MLB but really wanted to see the inside of this legendary ballpark.  So when I heard that Blue Jays will be in town playing the Red Sox, we couldn't resist.    ,We purchased tickets on the right side grandstand  section 7 which I was pretty happy with.  The price was also pretty affordable.  The day we watched the Red Sox were giving away ball caps which were an amazing souvenirs.  ,So being Canadian we had to cheer for the Canadian team, especially because I don't really watch baseball all the time.  I brought my Blue Jays hat, didn't really know if there would be other Jays / Canadians there because the series I watched landed on a midweek.  The Blue jays are doing awesome this year and yes had many fans out that night as well which was great to see.  We saw a family and a boy holding a sign ""We drove 900 km to cheer on the Blue Jays."" Though we are in Sox territory and man was Fenway alive.  People were super welcoming, friendly and loving their Red Sox.  Though I was cheering for the opposite team, it was really nice to see the fans here are so amazing it was like a party.  At the end Jays won the game but Sox fans were there till the bitter end, true fans.  ,The seats we had were the old seats and man did my butt hurt after seating there for some time.  Always I good reason to stand up and do the wave or grab a beer or a Fenway Frank! ,Overall you don't have to be baseball fan to have a good time especially in this ball park its absolutely one of a kind.  Must see if you're in Boston."
"Oh you fancy, huh, James?,Ready for a history lesson?  Back in the 20's Miami was very different, but very similar to the Miami of modern day.  It was a playground for the 1% who were tripping over themselves trying to buy up all the land and start their own vanity projects.,Enter Charles and James Deering.,Where as Charles (older sib) was the married, refined, art-collector and keen businessman behind International Harvester (yeah, THAT one), younger brother James was the enigmatic playboy more interested in champagne, opulence, and honies.,Vizcaya is James' crib.  If you're interested, the nearby Deering Estate (Cutler Bay) was Charles' house, and very beautiful as well.,This place is insane.  If you're in from out of town, you simply must put Vizcaya on your itinerary.  Built to resemble a Venetian manor, this three story pseudo-Italian mansion has extensive gardens, a sublime waterfront view, and a sunken grotto pool that must be seen to be believed.,Go here, bracing yourself for the inevitable crowds, heat, and carpel tunnel from holding your finger on the camera button.  Take one of the tours to get you some learnin' while you're at it.,And take your mom--she will definitely enjoy it. When's the last time you even called?"
"I really love public transportation. I think that it is a privilege and should be treated as such. With the recent circumstances involving my vehicle (RIP), I just opted to taking advantage of our public transportation system rather than having to ask people for rides all the time. ,Now, depending on what bus you get on, it can either be very nice or very sketchy. Overall, the system is actually pretty decent. The MAX bus is way nicer than the Metro buses, and you get to where you need to go faster. It's just sad that KC's public transit gets all of its bad rap from the people who don't even use it. ,I will say, there are just a couple of drivers who don't seem to know their routes as well as they should, or they will just zoom past bus stops that have no one waiting, which causes the bus to run early. That's really the only thing I (or anyone else) can complain about. ,When it's convenient, it's $1.50 with an unlimited 2-hour transfer pass any day of the week. The online trip planner makes it very easy to find your route, and they have hundreds of bus stops all over town. Besides the bizarre citizens that you WILL see on here, there is nothing wrong with using this service. So, keep doing what you do, KCATA, you're doing fine."
"Message to Edwin Lee:  Stun guns are not the answer. The citizens of San Francisco DO NOT NEED one more weapon in the hands of the SFPD. Edwin Lee, you are being stupidly short sighted. Edwin Lee, your actions will set the City of San Francisco up for lawsuits. Will you, Edwin Lee, Gavin Newsom & Willie Brown be paying for these lawsuits that will come if you arm our police with stun guns????  Where was Willie Brown at the recent town hall meeting in Bayview?  Where were you, Edwin Lee????,The residents and voters of San Francisco will not support further violence against our citizens.  Edwin Lee, your sneaky tactics of trying to push stun guns through the SFPD during the christmas holiday IS WRONG. Literally DEAD WRONG.,Edwin Lee, you think you have a fight on your hands, sir?  You have no idea what you're in for if you try to pass this."
"A place I can spend endless hours roaming the book shelves and hallways,  in search of something interesting to read. Look for me anywhere you can find biographies, history, religion, animals, cryptozoology or travel. And even though I no longer live in Los Angeles proper, still and always, this remains my main library of choice. Yes, I do have a card for the Santa Clarita Public Library too, but you can't beat Central Library for browsing.,Such beautiful architecture by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and magnificently restored after the disastrous Arson set fire in 1986, destroying some 400,000 volumes. 20 percent of the library's holdings. Originally constructed in 1926, the Central Library Goodhue Building, now officially named The Richard Riordan Central Library,  is the third largest public library in the United States in terms of book and periodical holdings, according to Wikipedia.,The building is a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, and its on the National Register of Historic Places."
"It's best to go to Project Rowhouse on a opening night or with someone that has gone prior.  The houses are not always exhibition spaces-they also are residency spaces at certain times of the year.  ,There are more than three houses-i think there are 7.  ,I've seen some really amazing installation pieces in these houses and it's always worth a try to see what's new inside them.  I will mention I have seen some so-so art here too, BUT you could say the same thing about the MFAH or any other large art museum."
"How can you not get chills thinking that America was born here. See the spot where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Amazing site to see.,Tickets are free and should be booked ahead of your trip here. Gets busy since this is one of the top sites in Philly.,Tour was not long at all and you get to walk through Independence Hall and pretend you remember what you learned in high school American History. ,Worth a visit. Soak in as much history as you can!"
"The Space Needle is a Washington staple (duh). You can probably visit a few times a year and still be amazed at the views every time you go. Be warned that it's fairly busy on the weekends, though.,We showed up at like three to buy tickets and weren't even able to get in line until  5:30 - we were at the top by six, so it wasn't too bad of a wait. Once up there, you're able to stay as long as you want! ,To get up to the Observation Deck, it's like $22 for adults, and $14 for kids. It's definitely pricy. They kind of soothe the burn of the price by offering  free photos at different spots around the needle and before you go up. ,The Space Needle is awesome to visit on a nice day if you have the extra money and it's somewhere you HAVE to take visitors."
"Good alternative to the Baltimore Tunnel when I-95 is backed up but there are only two bores (total of 2 lanes in each direction) so it can't handle as much throughput. It adds a few miles to your trip but could save an hour or more when I-95 is really bad. They keep the inside of the tunnel clean, unlike any of the disgusting NY tunnels that you pay double or triple for the benefit of crawling through their tunnels at a smooth 3 mph...if you're lucky."
"So beautiful. I had to do something touristy while on a work trip to DC, and the night of my departure I had some time to kill so a few friends that are local to the area took me to the memorial, as one of them had never been before. Getting to the memorial itself is not the easiest, as it's located across the basin from the Mall. The parking lot seemed a little sketch (especially at 8:30pm on Sunday) as it's set a good distance away from the Memorial. Despite this, the Memorial is a solid five stars. Loved it!,The walkway/sidewalk is wide and is winding along the path up to the memorial. Be mindful at night that there are no lights along the path, but enough ambient light from the city and light from the Memorial come through to make it dark, but not pitch black. It's a 10 minute walk if your pace is leisurely, but I didn't mind it. ,As you approach  the Memorial from the pathway, you come up along the side, and it's just breathtaking. It's expansive, with the statue of Mr. Jefferson in the center, with some of his most famous quotes etched on all ""sides"" of the circular building. There were only a small handful of people in the Memorial itself, and there is a small sign that asks guests to be quiet and respectful to preserve the air of reflection. It evoked a lovely sense of calm, reflection and reverence in me, and it's probably one of the most beautiful monuments I've experienced.,Upon entrance, there is a mall information center to the left, and a gift shop and restrooms to the right. Info and the shop were both closed that late and night, but I would encourage anyone to go at night. The views across the basin to the mall are lovely with all the lights, and the stark lightness of the memorial against the night sky is not to be missed."
"These guys are about as good as it gets. They are fast fast fast. Word to the wise, you don't even need to bring your registration renewal notice. If you have your drivers license, that's all you need. Just make sure you've gotten your emissions done."
"Guys - this place is ACTUALLY helpful and quick. I've been to many government offices and much feel like i'm just a number with no personality or that i'm not in need of some help...,Front desk = very helpful. Asked what I needed help with and told me where to head.,Check In Area = Two security guards, helpful in pointing where to check in, how to check in, and what to do. I had brought coffee in, and instead of making me throw it out, i just had to drink it outside the office. I could still hear all the numbers being called and one security guard waited with me and had a lovely conversation.,Window = I was getting my name changed after being married. The lady behind the window was super helpful and efficient. Had me check over all my information twice before submitting. She ALSO kept saying ""Congratulations on your Marriage, isn't that wonderful"" - and was legit about it.,All in all, in and out in less than 30 minutes. I did go in at 7:15 (doors open at 7:30) but the security guard said get there before 8am and you'll go through quicker.,Why a missing star? If you could set up appointments, that would be a nice touch."
"This is such a great venue. It has access to the water, great views of Canada, and is large enough to host Movement Festival and its guests. The plaza is relatively clean and is in the center of downtown Detroit."
"We were not even looking for it but we ended up driving by And I asked my hubby to stop, so we did.  It was late and warm on a Saturday evening.  We had just taken a drive over to the Galleria for no good reason and happened to pass by the water wall.  We parked up in a parking building across  the street and walked over.  How grand, and how nice on a warm evening to feel the mist of the water caress your face.  It was cool but at the same time I actually got dizzy constantly looking up And and down and all around. But it was a wonderful experience.  When I started to feel light headed I turned to look over at the grassy area across from the wall and there was this sweet couple just sitting on the grass enjoying each other's company.  Romantic and sweet spot.  It's a nice addition to such a busy area of town. You forget where you are and become enamored by the flowing water.  Is it going up ? Is it falling down? Oh my!"
"This place is absolutely amazing. I came in on the 5th with an appointment, had all of my paperwork ready but arrived a little late due to it being almost impossible to find parking. Still was serviced as number C360 and when I sat down I noticed they were already calling C354. I was seen at the window and told to come back for my passport two days later! My trip was on the 13th so needless to say I was ecstatic. This place is great. Just fill out the application before hand, bring all of your documents and payment, but most importantly, MAKE AN APPOINTMENT."
"Fenway Park is the stuff of legend.  Seriously.  Setting aside any team preference, one must acknowledge Fenway Park's adherence to the original intent of the field itself.  What most strikes me is the original 1934 hand-operated scoreboard and the original 1934 grandstand seats.  Other teams have had to endure ever-modernizing stadiums to keep up with perceived fan desires.  Boston, understandably, has done everything possible to retain the original feel of this legendary ballpark.  ,For those wishing to experience baseball the way three generations experienced it, look no further than Fenway.,On a personal note - my father hooked more school than one would generally care to admit.  When he did hook, he could generally be found in Fenway's bleachers - 1952,53,54."
"Our wonderful docent, David, shared a lot of interesting stories and information about the house with us.  Having a guided tour really enhances your visit!  Adding the guided tour to your admission isn't very expense and completely worth it.  ,This house was built about 100 years ago when the population of Miami was very small.  The front door is actually facing the water, because that is how many people made their way to the house.  I loved the elaborate barge.  Many of the rooms are decorated according to themes: Chinese, Spanish, Venician, etc and no expense was spared!  David told us that Mr. Deering, the original owner, actually bought much of the furniture and fixtures in Europe before his house was constructed and had rooms designed around certain purchases.,The gardens are kept up and very impressive.  I loved the fountains and sculptures."
"This would be a much better review if I did not ride the bus on weekends.,I live just off of a bus line and I get a bus pass. I used to ride the bus all the time in Des Moines and it has always been inconvenient since moving here (live in MO, worked in KS, or lived in KS.)  Now that I live in an area where using the bus is an option, I love it. I save a ton of money on gas and maintenance. I don't have to deal with traffic or pay to park. It increases my activity level. I meet a lot of people I otherwise never would have. ,During the week the bus is pretty reliable. Weekends is another story. I am not sure what happens Friday night, but you can expect severely late buses or buses running way ahead of schedule, drivers who don't know the routes and either go the wrong way or miss stops, but generally friendlier than the weekday drivers.,The metro works well for me. I think it gets a bad rep from people who don't use it. It also has challenges as an actual ""metro"" system. Some cohesion between the burbs is greatly needed, especially the Kansas side and Johnson County."
"I didn't have enough time to go inside the building but it definitely felt like it was the center of town, nestled in with other government and public offices as well as the Asian Art Museum. Really beautiful architecture. It is bordering the Tenderloin area which does seem a little shadier during odd times of the day so perhaps better to do during working hours if you're a tourist. But a standard city hall-style building when compared to other major cities around the country."
"I love it this place is ,Deep  clean ,And I loved,D taking pictures in this place  ,I visited for the cherry blossom and I love it ,Safe place"
"Yes, I visited a library while I was in LA. It was near our hotel, so why not? We had time to kill. The library is on the National Register of Historic Places. If you're a fan of architecture, then check it out. Checking out a book doesn't hurt either. My friend and I just walked around a bit. I thought the rotunda with the globe chandelier and murals was the best part of the library. There's a garden too, but we didn't really walk around it due to homeless people hanging out. If you're interested, they give tours of the library."
"""Like a lotus flower that grows out of the mud and blossoms above the muddy water surface"",This is what I think about the project row houses.  These houses sit in a very seedy area of town, but they stand out and are a glowing example that beauty can be found anywhere as long as you are willing to look for it."
"If you're a native Houstonian like me, you've probably heard of Project Row Houses a few times in your life, but you've never visited.  It's time to change that.,I don't think there's another space in Houston that exudes such creativity, cultural understanding, and respect for art and people of all kinds.  Spanning 4 city blocks, Project Row Houses includes the famous row houses with rotating art installations, countless outdoor sculptures and murals, a playground/garden space with more art, housing for low-and-mid income residents, housing and programs for young mothers, and educational programs for young people.  Above all, it centers around the third ward community that is, because of its proximity to all things midtown, in danger of becoming Houston's next condoland.,When you go, first stop by the headquarters of Project Row Houses.  It's a brick building next to the row houses.  There's some great info to get you started on your quest as you walk in the door, and if you're lucky like I was, you might happen upon some men engaged in a serious game of dominoes.  Rick, one of the domino players, gave me a good intro to the place and called up Ashley, the Public Arts Manager, to show me the lay of the land.  I spent the good part of 2 hours wandering the premises, and I left with a new appreciation of art itself and a much better understanding of the third ward.,As for the art, both inside the houses and outside, it's mind-bending.  Take your time, explore all the nooks and crannies, and make sure you haven't missed anything.  Don't forget the flower man, either: he's not officially part of Project Row Houses, but he's right next door.  Flower man's house is decorated with wacky fixtures of all kinds, and he's an masterpiece himself."
"No tickets required in January or February... and we figured out why, its bleeding cold!,We had a few hours before heading back to SoCal, and came here on a Wednesday in February, and the place was empty.  Its walking distance (across the park) from the Liberty Bell.  Find this little door and that'll take you to the security area for Independence Hall.  ,We had just missed the tour, and the next one was in 15 minutes at 11:45 am.  We didn't have much time, so a few of us opted to not stay and to head over to Betsy Ross' house.  A few of my friends did stay and said the tour was no different than going to Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, CA , so I was glad I skipped it.,We did check out the building next door which had drafts of our Declaration.  ,Too bad I only had 3 hours to play tourist. I'd come back to visit again."
"I thought this was going to be just a tourist experience and although it was crowed with plenty of tourists snapping pictures the views of Seattle were breath taking.,I strongly advise taking a few moments to read the history as you walk up the ramp to the elevators for your journey.  There is quiet a lot to learn.  Once up above the city you will find an array of light refreshments to purchase and coffee as you look out at the Emerald City.,Overall, don't miss it and make sure to purchase a ticket for the Space needle and Chihuly Glass Garden as well."
"I find it hard to review tunnels and highways.  However, for most destinations, you can choose between this tunnel and the I-95 tunnel so I figured I would share my opinions.,This tunnel has some drawbacks to it, but I will take it if the traffic is backed up on the I-95 tunnel.  The good news is that it gets you under the Bay without drowning so that is a huge positive in my book.,The drawbacks are that this is a very narrow tunnel compared to most I have traversed so that can freak you out a lot.  There are only two bores, so that also means there is often two way traffic in the tunnel, which can REALLY freak you out.  For some reason, two way traffic in a tunnel makes me pretty uncomfortable.  The access roads are 50 mph speed limits compared to 55 on the I-95 tunnel.,This tunnel is fine, but you might prefer the I-95 tunnel."
"The Jefferson Memorial is a breathtaking memorial on the Tidal Basin that gets most of its visitors during cherry blossom season when the flowers and the people abound. I've never visited during cherry blossom season and although I know all the people would drive me crazy, the photos look SO PRETTY I just have to come back one day.,The memorial is massive with large marble columns around the building. I love how the temperature drops a few degrees when you walk inside the memorial. The statue on the middle is beautiful and it is surrounded by quotes from Jefferson on the walls. This memorial is a bit of a hike, but it is worth it. You can walk around the Tidal Basin to see the FDR Memorial and the MLK Memorial too."
"Always very helpful and never a long wait! I used to dread going to the Tag office due to long lines, rude reps etc. This place is definitely above the ordinary. In and out within 15mins every time!"
"Got to Penn at 8:45 hopped on the 2 to Fulton, got back to Penn by 9:30. This place is super convenient as its right by the subway, its clean, and the staff is friendly.  ,I got there, got a number (B90) and they were up to B88. Damn so quick and effortless. This is a true diamond in the rough when it comes to SS Offices. I am glad I read the reviews on yelp and took the chance with coming here. It was a great success! :)"
"If you have friends who have never visited Detroit before coming into town, I vote that Hart Plaza is right on up there with the People Mover to convince them that Detroit isn't one giant post-apocalyptic hellhole.  ,We recently entertained an out-of-town friend who was concerned about just that...and in the end he (and my husband and I, who haven't visited for a few years) were extremely impressed at Hart Plaza.  Kinda reminded me of my pre-conceived notions about Las Vegas, only to find out that the sidewalks (at least on the main strip) are kept absolutely spotless.  It's nice to be proven wrong!,Anyway, the plaza, along with that stretch of Riverwalk, was spic-and-span, and there was subtle but present security patrolling the area.  It ended up being one of our friend's favorite spots to see, and I wouldn't hesitate to head back down on my own.  Lovely views up and down the river and, of course...(""Hey, there's Canada!"" -our friend).  ,If I worked nearby, I'd trot my brown-bag lunch out here every day in nice weather!"
"The Williams Waterwall........... is so... flipping beautiful, at night at least cause that's when I was able to see this beautiful landmark.,This is smack-dab in downtown Houston where you can park on the side street (if you're feeling balls-z) or in the parking structure where you pay by the minutes/hour. Luckily for me, the lady didn't charge me at all because she believe that the waterfall is just a great experience that you can't put a price on (wooohoo and boy is that true). ,It doesn't look like you can get lost in it, but if you step in the center (mind you, the water will slash and you get wet) you'll forget where you are. Such a beautiful experience.,Bring your significant other if they're into mushy things."
"I applied for my daughters passport 7 weeks ago. She's adopted from China so naturally there is more paperwork than normal to be processed. Two weeks after I sent the information off from our local passport office/post office, received a letter requesting additional documentation. I called the automated line and spoke to several different technicians to follow up with the letter and requested documents. They are clueless and completely inefficient. They did manage to have someone from the agency call me back. The person who called me back told me the exact form I needed and that it should be expedited if I wanted to get in time for our trip. I did so and followed up again three days later. I was informed they still needed an additional document. Since I was one week away from travel I was told to make an appointment and come into the office if I wanted it processed in time. I scheduled an appointment and went in person to the office today at 10:00.  I arrived one hour early because I wanted to give myself time. Even though I had an appointment, I still stood in line with all of the walk-in's. So, regardless of you have an appointment....they process the walk-in's the same. Plan to be there for at least an hour and a half to two hours. In my case they told me I needed an original of a document I had submitted weeks prior (keep in mind I had spoken to a representative just last week that told me I only needed to bring ""one"" additional document to the office. Since I'm a paranoid person by nature, I had my folders in the car with every document imaginable. ,Once they accepted all documents, including the hard copy travel itinerary, they gave me a slip of paper and told me to come back between 3-4 to get the passport. I got back right at 3. I received a number and set back in the waiting area with a bunch of others. So, they call the numbers randomly. Doesn't matter if you get there right at 3 and you are given the #1 card....they call them in whatever order makes sense to them. I wasn't called until 3:30. There were lots of people called before me and when I left, the waiting area was packed as well as the halls.,In a nutshell: $40. Parking (lots of parking close to building), tolls around $15., hard copy itinerary, originals of any forms (copies will not suffice). In my case my daughter who is 13 had to be with me and her birth certificate and adoption forms all had to be original with seals intact. Go on knowing you will devote your entire day to it...3 hours at the facility. Automated personnel are clueless and unhelpful. Appointments aren't necessary, even though they stress that they are. ,I rely heavily on reviews and hope mine helps you."
"Even a Yankees fan, like me, can appreciate such a historical ballpark. I must admit that I was really looking forward to coming here for the 1st time in my life! The ballpark was everything I thought it would be, nostalgic, full of character and lively.  There was a certain energy and vibe in the surrounding area and in the park.,There weren't many advertisements either, unlike many ballparks today that feel commercialized. I loved the atmosphere surrounding the park, especially all the fans hanging out on Yawkey Way and the Red Sox banners hanging around. We got to the ballpark early and walked around the exterior and interior and, to my surprise, the ballpark was in pretty good condition. Despite being one of the oldest MLB stadiums, the ballpark was well kept. ,As for the inside, it definitely had a cozy feel to it. It looks as small inside as advertised, but it just fit the area. The views of the field were great from inside as well. I loved that they had a small outdoor eating area near one of the entrances too and we could smell all of the food being cooked up. Everything about the ballpark was just perfect! Hopefully they never tear this down to create one of those new super stadiums.,One final tidbit I had was regarding parking. If you plan on driving to the stadium, you can find street parking 1-2 blocks away. Don't settle on parking in the lots, unless you really have to"
"Built by wealthy Chicago banker James Deering as a summer home, Vizcaya is probably the closest you can get to being in a European backdrop in Miami. ,The gardens outside are beautiful, it reminded me of Versailles. The building itself has a lot of history. The architecture is a mix of Italian and French. ,I found the outside more fun to walk through and explore than the inside unless you fancy rustic old bed rooms and bathrooms. Although I must admit some of the bedroom themes were interesting.,I recommend coming during a cooler month, otherwise you will roast outside but a few groups of chicas didn't seem to mind waltzing around in big poofy dresses for their quiñcenera.,Worth coming to for a couple hours. Come early as the house and gardens started filling up with patrons after noon and the free parking lots were full. They currently have discounted tickets (a whopping $2) due to some areas undergoing renovation, though as I write this review they might already have completed it."
"If I had another option to choose another bus company, I would. I only ride with kcata because I am forced to, and have no other choice.,That being said, the way this company functions is absolutely horrendous. If you need info on a bus, and it's ""after hours"" you're just crap out of luck! In addition to that, the 35th street bus is CONSISTENTLY late by 5 minutes EVERY day of the week!,I had an accident with the Metro where I had to call customer service, and the employee I spoke to was EXTREMELY rude, and RAISED HIS VOICE AT ME, when I requested to immediately be transferred to customer service. THEN, he hung up on me. Every time I called back it was the same guy too!! I FINALLY got transferred, but my transfer to customer service was a FIFTY MINUTE WAIT TIME. A FIFTY minute wait time to talk to a human being at 4 pm on a weekday. ,When I finally was in contact with a customer service representative, he said there were only TWO CUSTOMER SERVICE EMPLOYEES WORKING. Only two?? For the ENTIRE KCATA metro customer service line? What the hell?? This people need to get their crap together.,Late buses, rude drivers, horrible customer service system, filthy buses (Roach infestation in the back of the troost max bus...), and overall terrible quality. Not a bus company you can depend on, and not a transportation service that gives a crap about the people!"
"Got married here last month January 2016! Reserved online for the marriage registration and the ceremony and the rest was history!! Gorgeous building inside and out to have as a back drop for your pictures. It's cool to see the kids on their field trip to the city hall. It's breathtaking to see in person, especially the ceiling architecture. Best to wear low heels or flats so you wont slip or fall from the steps. For your ceremony location, you can choose from a private room or at the rotunda. Most of the couples choose the rotunda for the ceremony location. You won't be disappointed for choosing this for your wedding venue."
"With a fitting tribute to one of the country's greatest founding fathers, this is a wonderful stretch in the heart of Washington's tidal basin.,Monument history area downstairs was quite fascinating. Peaceful and serene atmosphere while smaller crowds observe with beautiful and scenic views.,Bathrooms stand at this memorial that is extremely convenient.,Less to see compared to other surrounding buildings but definitely worth the extra mile as this will always be a meaningful memorial."
This is some place to treasure. Work or school this place is the best to get a peace of mind and concentrate on what ever your goal is. It's hard not to get things done here. No one knows you know one bothers you. Just sit and tackle all your problems and goals here. I wouldn't go any where else. If it's job searching or looking for a new way to hustle your gonna come up with ideas and creativity here. Just block everything else out.
"If you were to put on a vinyl of Weldon Irvine's ""Morning Sunrise"" and brew some fresh ""sun-kissed tea"" or ""sweet lemonade"" - then go to the front porch and just relax your eyelids until you finally drift into that deep place called home; you would be the personification of Project Row Houses.  Sometimes the most beautiful flower breaks through the broken, filthy concrete.  The art displayed in this exhibit reveals more than just a forgotten neighborhood,  as it portrays a certain time and a people who have a rich culture and an enormous sense of pride - no matter what they are surrounded by.  I would advise every Houstonian to visit the place that they, perhaps, have only heard of but never really understood - and embrace the Project that is so much more than just an homage to a poor housing development."
"Definitely come here if you are in the area! You will not be disappointed! I thought it was really cool to visit the place where the country was started. Tickets are free, so that's a plus!"
"It's hard to give this place less than five stars given that it's the original home to the creation of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.  ,Groups of twenty to thirty-ish are ushered in at a time for a thirty minute tour/history refresher on each of the rooms in the building. It was very humbling to stand where history was made and imagine our founding fathers working by candlelight. ,Winter warning: we waited outside forty minutes in the line before making our way to the security checkpoint. Free to enter once you make it. Rumor has it, you can reserve time slots during the warmer/busier months. ,Located across the street from the Liberty Bell Center and the property that once housed the first presidential home of the United States. (Now a public restroom)"
"At the first sight of Space Needle, I was in awe. As time went by, I got over it. Since we were out of town and being ""touristy"", we wanted to go up to see all of Seattle.,Nearly $50 for two people?!,I was originally from Chicago and living in San Francisco, I already have seen the great views, so we decided to opt out.,Instead, use that money to go to the restaurant. I've heard that it also has great views, and the food was affordable, so it's a double entendre.,Will be back for the restaurant!"
"$4 seems a bit much for a tunnel, even if it goes through/under downtown. I found it to be a bit narrow as tunnels go."
"I visited the Jefferson Memorial over the weekend on Saturday. It was quite a sight, and is located in Washington, DC near the Washington monument. Its a public monument so there isn't any fee or security you have to worry about. Just some walking from the National Mall. Being the Jefferson Memorial, its dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, one of America's founding fathers.It is surrounded by circular marble steps that lead into a marble dome and in the very middle stands a bronze statue of Jefferson himself. Not much to complain besides it being a bit windy but just dress for the appropriate weather."
"Holy crap. I was so afraid of this place based on some of the things I'd read. But you have nothing to fear. My experience, at least on this Friday afternoon, was that they were very helpful and friendly. I walked in expecting to have to pay a boatload of fines because I was late registering for my car tag. I walked out with a smile on my face, tag in hand, having paid nothing more than the regular registration fee. If you're like me, and you're a little bit OCD and tend to over-prepare for things like this, you can breathe easily.,Pro tip: If, like me, you wait more than 30 days after switching your insurance to Georgia to get a tag, you'll need to call your insurance company and have them re-upload your information to the state system, or the people in the office won't see it on file. If you forget, the insurance company can fax a binder directly to the office, it'll just take a few extra minutes once you're there.,A previous poster said parking was at least $10, but you can park for $3 at the Underground Atlanta garage, right across the street. Or park for free at your local MARTA station and walk 5 minutes from Five Points."
"No need to put it off really. This was a well oiled machine from where I stood. I needed to change my name because I got married. But I'm the world's biggest procrastinator so I asked for a little time off to go get this done before work this morning. I was anticipating waiting forever. Not so. I was sitting for maybe 6 minutes. Smooth experience. Your standard government employees but I wasn't expecting much. I went in with low expectations and this office exceeded them.,I also made it in to work before my whole team. So I consider this an extremely successful trip."
"Have been going here for years since childhood, most recently watched the annual fireworks display in late June 2014. Great concrete city park on Detroit River for enjoying an afternoon strolling along the riverfront. Awesome sculptures and lounging areas as well. Vendor food options available during the day. Very close and easy walking access to other downtown Detroit attractions. Perfect views of river, Ambassador Bridge, and Canada. Fireworks at Hart Plaza in June is a must do! Annual weekend techno festival in May also at Hart Plaza, planning to go this year for the first time.- Faiz Ikramulla"
We came here because of the ratings. It's a waterwall. I would give it 3 stars but no... It's a waterwall. I don't understand people who rave about it. Knock yourselves out. Sorry but I don't get it. Next
"My son was traveling to Prague on a school trip that had been booked through a travel agency. When we got to the airport he was told he could not travel because his passport would expire in less than 3 months. Another student was also denied travel for the same reason. The kids were devastated. (And needless to say, a tersely worded review of the travel agency WILL be written).,The airline was as helpful as could be and directed us to the number to renew the passports. But panic set in as the ""Appointment Specialist at the 1-877 number was less than helpful in trying to help us procure an appointment that was before the school trip actually ended. ,We thought all hope was lost, when I happened to yelp and find Bridget I's awesome review (it was the first listed)! THANK GOODNESS! It was so helpful!,Here are my additional tips for making this a successful process:,1) Call the 1-877-487-2778 and, if you don't want to wait for all the verbage (there is too much) here are the numbers to push at each prompt:,1 - for English,2 - to make an appointment at a regional center,1 - to make an appointment within the next two weeks,1 - for a new appointment,4 - for the central region,1 - for Chicago,1 - for the first available appointment,1 - to accept the appointment,Here you have to enter information and get the confirmation number before hanging up. Bring that number with you to your appointment.,2) Download and fill out the form you will need. For us it was the DS-11. If you are unsure you can call the 1-877 number and speak with a customer service rep or appointment specialist. They are good at giving you the general information that you could get from the website, but don't expect them to be helpful in getting an earlier appointment. They are useless in that aspect.,3) Get your passport pictures taken (we went to Walgreens) and attach one photo to form.,4) You will need proof of travel (ticket or itinerary) and ID's -- at the very least a driver's license and perhaps a birth certificate. The 1-877 people can tell you exactly what you need to bring. MAKE COPIES of all of these to turn in with you application. IMPORTANT: front AND back of IDs!,5) If you're a frantic mom such as myself, clean out your purse before you go. It's pretty embarrassing and unsettling to have to watch some poor guy sifting through tampons and candy wrappers to find that itty bitty Swiss Army knife that ALWAYS comes in handy EXCEPT in cases like this!,6) DO arrive before 8 am so that you have time to get through security where some frantic mom has stalled the line because she didn't clean out her purse. Also, you want to take advantage of early bird parking specials if you drove (we paid $15 for all day parking a block East on Adams).,7) DO wait on the second floor as directed before 8:15. You will be scolded and sent back down if you disobey.,8) DO take the elevator up to 18 as close to 8:15 as possible. There you will line up in an orderly fashion. No calls can be made on this floor so put your ringer on silent. You CAN text.,9) They will ask how many people have an appointment. Technically you do. Don't feel the need to explain to the security guard that it's not for two weeks. You can explain at the counter where they must hear that a lot because they seemed totally okay with it. You will turn in your documents, pay the $195 fee (make sure you have a credit card, money order, checkbook, or exact cash). While you do this you will notice a sign that says same day processing orders have to be in before 9:30 am. Whew! You did it!,10) They will tell you that they will process your passport for 1 pm and to arrive between 1 and 4. We arrived early and had to wait 40 minutes. Our friend arrived at 1:30 and got his right away. This waiting area is the only bad part of the process. It is quiet and cramped and people are a little on edge because numbers seemed to be called in random order. Be one of the lucky ones who can walk right in and get their passport right away by waiting an hour or two.,11) Check your passport. Make sure you got all your documents back. And sign it! And I would strongly suggest scanning it or making a copy before you leave for your trip.,Safe Travels!!"
"If you say anything bad about the oldest baseball stadium in the country, then you're just rude. ,This place is amazing.  No other words.  Is it old? Yes. Small? Incredibly.  But it's a tiny little city within a city.  It's amazing.  The sights, smells, sounds- priceless.  Go.  It's amazing"
"The mansion is massive, and extremely gaudy. But I suppose it's an enjoyable enough place to explore if you want to see how someone mind-bendingly rich would have lived at the turn of the last century.,But the real place to be is outside, in the gardens. Truly one of the most breathtaking estates anywhere in the world, and it gives you an idea of what can be achieved with unlimited funds.,I'm not in sight entirely certain, but I think it may be possible to skip the inside of the property and not pay to go visit the gardens. If you can do that, this is an unbeatable deal! But it's probably still worth paying the $16 per person charge to get to see the whole thing. ,Keep in mind parts of the property are currently under construction, that's why it's only $16 per person. Normally it would be $18."

"My sister and her husband recently had their wedding ceremony here. It's still a beautiful, well-kept venue. It was just how I remembered it from my junior prom back in my high school days. The ceremony was beautiful, which is all I could ask for for my sister on her special day. We were just bombarded by angry protester outside of the building after the ceremony, which really rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of taking photos directly outside of City Hall, since they kept getting in the way and were extremely annoying, we just decided to do the photo shoot across the street.,Besides the rude protesters, I still love this place!"
"1. Where is the site? ,Washington, DC,2. Is there a fee? ,No,3. Who is the site for? ,President Thomas Jefferson,4. What makes up the site (is it a single monument? A park? A historic building?)  ,consisted of a half-circle memorial situated next to a circular basin, and a statue of Thomas Jefferson inside the building.,5. When did you go? ,April, 2016,6. Why did you give it the rating you did?,The site is located in the heart of Washington's tidal basin. Combining History and Nature is what captivates me about this site. The reflection of the memorial on the water, especially when it's the peak of the cherry blossoms."
"Where to start?  From the free and low-cost workshops, to author readings, art exhibits, book and music selection - you can even borrow a laptop here - the Central Library is what all other libraries should aspire to be.,However, my review hones in on the kid-centric areas that make up the library.  The Children's department is wonderful in it's selection and architecture, much like the rest of the building.  They offer books, cds, and dvds in English, and other languages too, but mostly in Spanish.  ,About every day of the week, they offer children's programs to promote literacy.  However they save their bigger events for Saturday afternoons where they offer, among other things, puppet shows - which my kids love - in the theater.,But there's more!  Their connections to the community and budget allow for even cooler programs, which are held in a bigger auditorium on the main floor.  My kids have participated in science festivals, seen music performances about the history of the US, listened to wonderful storytellers, danced with African performers, and the list goes on.,In a couple of weeks, they'll kick off their Summer Reading program:,My only suggestion would be to expand the limited collection of kids audiobooks - the picture books with cds.  The Santa Monica branches in our neighborhood have more in this regard, but I'll let that slide ...for now :),Whenever we're in DTLA, we stop by and visit for a while.  Our entire family treasures it here."
"I was so disappointed by the place!  It's in the projects but you feel safe walking around and parking your car on the street. Nothing to worry about there!,However, a lot of the houses were closed.  There was nothing to see really.  There was not one person in sight that could explain any of the artwork (if you can really call it that) in any of the three houses we entered.  I do like the concept but I hoped to see people and art.  I felt more like I walked into a kindergarten class."
"A couple of reasons why you should come and visit the Independence Hall while in Philly:,1) It's free to go on the tour (go to the visitor center to obtain the free tickets, but go early before they run out),2) The historical significance of this building, and,3) 'Murica!,'Nuff said!"
"Seattle's landmark and one of many things you must do for visitors such as myself. It's just the tourist thing to do. I was glad to find that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. We parked about a block away and had no difficulty finding a spot. Tickets were also equally as easy punching keys using the kiosk. ,At top, there is a snack bar. From coffee to beer, they got it. Statistics displays on the wall how many visitors have visited and how far they have traveled. The view is great and it pretty much pitched me an idea of possibly moving to this city one day. Be the responsible tourist and put this on your checklist."
"Cash only. If you learn nothing else from reading this review, please remember to have $4 cash ready to pay these folks because if you don't there isn't an alternative. Many areas allow you to mail in a toll payment if you can't pay at the booth. I definitely prefer that to having a notice or ticket mailed to you.,I had to laugh. It was a few days before Christmas and even though I knew better, I let my boyfriend convince me that all toll roads accepted credit cards. Nope. Sucks us because the $4 toll increases to $6 if you drive through without paying. That seems kind of stupid for a lot of reasons.,First, what's the difference between kindly telling the toll attendant that you don't have enough to pay and just driving through the E-Z Pass lane? I guess just courtesy because there isn't a reward. The jerks are treated the same as the good guys. Seems like Maryland DOT could stick it to the jerks and increase their fee from $6 to something substantial. Trust me, next time I'm just plowing through.,Apparently they mail a notice within 30 days and then you send them back $6. If there were an envelope or form they could pass out AT THE TOLL BOOTH most people would likely mail a payment much more quickly. I feel like that would increase collection rates.,Anyway, this is well above my pay scale and I'm not an urban planner or transportation expert. I have to assume someone who knows more than me is making good decisions. Lulz..."
"Although the memorial for our third president and primary author of the Declaration of Independence was not completed until 1943, it is more than fitting that this patriot share space with Washington and Lincoln  in the DC National Mall. The open-air design with marble steps and columns is unique, but provides an almost 360 degree view of the imposing 19-foot, five-ton bronze statue placed at its center. On one wall are excerpts from the Declaration. Below the dome, in a frieze, are his words: ""I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."" A wonderful tribute to one of our most cherished and beloved Founding Fathers."
"I went here to get a tag renewal, and I was really surprised that it only took me 5 minutes. I didn't have to wait, it was really fast.,My recommendation would be to go always to in the ""middle"". With this I mean, in the middle of the month, the middle of the week, the middle of morning or the afternoon. NEVER go early in the morning when most people go before work, or at lunch hour. ,Btw, they do not accept credit cards. Only cash and checks. ,There is an ATM in the same building if you need to withdraw money. ,Before you go make sure you have:,1) ID/ Drivers License ,2) Car insurance,3) Emission Inspection,4) 2 Utilities bills ( if you are changing address)  ,5) Cash or Checks."
Hands down the best government agency office I have ever been to. It's inside the office building on the 3rd and 4th floors. The security staff are super helpful and kind and the ticketing service is fast and efficient. Just have all of your documents with you and you'll be out in 15 minutes (I've gone morning and afternoon and both times have been super quick). Wish every other office could be this seamless and amazing.
"The eye of Detroit. Hart Plaza has and always will be just one of those spots you go to on a nice day in the D.

"AMAZING! ,Loved this site. Right in front of the Williams Tower. ,I parked on the small street next to the waterfall with my emergencies since there isn't street parking. In and out in a few minutes.,Standing there with the water splashing down is so calming. ,A Houston must see."
"The Chicago Passport Agency is located on the 18th floor of the Kluczynski Federal Building. The office is used mostly by those who need their visa or passport paperwork expedited. For example, one lady there today was FREAKINGout because she needed a visa for a Cambodia flight a scant four hours hence. ,Its best if you make an appointment in advance. Upon arrival your documents (application, pictures, itineraries, etc.) are checked for completeness. If you've got everything, you're given a number and asked to take a seat. When your number is called you have a consultation, pay the bill and are given a receipt and a pick-up time. $170 for an expedited passport renewal. ,The office is set up for efficient flow with two check-in counters and a dozen workstations. There are federal security agents all over that place - two when you get off the elevator, two in the office, five in total within 30 square meters. The gent helping me today was smart, helpful and fast. Apparently this is normal here.,The Federal building was completed in 1974 and named in honor of Illinois Congressman John Kluczynski. Like much of the architecture in Chicago, this 45-story glass, granite and steel building is no slouch. The surrounding plaza is also quite nice and contains a Calder (Flamingo) - also completed in 1974. ,In my travels I'm sometimes asked to document where my passport was issued. It was kind of cool visiting the place that I've noted so many times in so many places."
"The oldest ballpark in MLB dating back to 1912. Its a once in a lifetime experience to be able to see a ball game at Fenway. So knowing the Red Sox were in town and their 2015 season wasn't doing the best I decided to try go get tickets on game day. If you are into this they start selling them 1:30 hr before the game. Ticket options go from $19 for a bleacher to well over $100 behind home plate. I decided to go middle of the road at $50 just along the first base line. ,The park is like many old sporting stadiums. Rich in history and incredible in it's own right. There places where there are photos of Ted Williams, an area of all the different logos in the 100+ year history. Souvenir shops and all sorts of everything Red Sox related. Food options are plentiful. There is a Yawkeys way where the food stands are a plenty and you can fill up on a Fenway Frank or Italian sausage on a bun. My choice in the 3rd inning was an Italian sausage on bun. With mustard it was downright delicious. ,7th inning you get up to sing take me out to the ball game and 8th inning Neil Diamond and sweet Caroline comes on. It feels like you are in some movie as you sing along with the crowd. It's an experience to be had. Red Sox won on the night I was there vs. KC Royals so the mood was cheerful. Great times!"
"I love this place!  I took my mom when she came to visit me in Miami. She loves flowers and gardens so I knew it would be a winner. ,They offer an audio tour, I really recommend it if you like history. It's very informational and not boring at all. ,I recommend going on a cooler day, since the gardens are outside and there's a lot to see!"
"It's actually pretty terrible when a bus comes 12 minutes early.  If the bus is that early it needs to stop.  The bus passes me while I'm walking to the stop about 3 times a week.  I live 2 minutes from the bus stop and if I'm leaving my apartment 15 minutes before the bus is supposed to come** I shouldn't miss the bus--it should not pass me while I'm waiting at the stop light across the street. ,**When the bus should come is really subject to, say, the WIND! There is no rhyme or reason.  There are five bus schedules that exist.  ,1) the one on the KCATA website ,2) the one on Google Transit ,3) the one printed out and framed at the bus stop ,4) the brochure on the actual bus ,5) the time the bus actually comes (this one is just a guessing game--soooo FUN!),Here's the thing about KCATA.  Maybe 12 minutes early isn't so bad because there SHOULD be another bus coming.  But no.  The Main Street Max bus, for example, has 2 versions. One that goes from downtown to Waldo and then turns around and goes back downtown, and then there is also one that goes from downtown to the Plaza and then turns around and goes back downtown.  If you are waiting for a Waldo bound max bus and it comes 12 minutes late, you have to wait sometimes up to 50 minutes for the NEXT Waldo bound Max bus to show up, because the bus right after the one you missed is not going to be going to Waldo.  That's terrible.  That is unnecessary and it is stupid.   ,The drivers have been so rude to the tourists on the busses I frequent, which are the main lines through tourist heavy areas.  You want public transit to thrive? MAKE A PLAN THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND UNIVERSAL.  If you aren't going to do that, the least you could do is have helpful driver.  I've been riding the bus for 13 years the the drivers I've had for about the last year are just AWFUL.  They will ZOOM through Crown Center 10 minutes before they are supposed to be there, and fly right by a group of people whose heads are down looking at maps. They pass people on 43rd street who are running to the stop even though the bus is early , and this is especially sad in poor weather.  The drivers will say ""They should have been there.""  WHAT THE ACTUAL EFF?  ,Kansas City is such a beautiful grid.  I feel like the lines are too complicated and inefficient.  The call center is not helpful if you are upset because the bus is 12 minutes early and they can't tell you if the bus is actually really LATE, which also happens.  They can't tell you which schedule is right. .  There aren't printed schedules at enough stops.  The lines are inefficient. There aren't enough of them on major roads.  They don't go out to enough suburban things.  There should be an airport express from downtown--no other stops.  There should be a Zona Rosa express from downtown--no extra stops.  ,Yadda Adda."
"I've been to many special events and weddings here, and it's just a BEAUTIFUL location! The architecture and design is so pretty and it's well maintained. I always love seeing how they light it up at night for special occasions (holidays and sports)."
"Absolutely gorgeous at night! The memorial itself isn't as grand as the Lincoln Memorial but the night time view is fantastic. There are also restrooms downstairs, with an exhibit on Jefferson's life and contributions. There is also a gift shop if you're a true Jeffersonphile. ,The biggest struggle with the Jefferson Memorial is how far away it is from all the other memorials. I'd recommend coming by car rather than attempting to walk it."
"Surprisingly huge and lovely inside.  Also - not that I am encouraging this, because the library is reason enough to go - but if for some reason you happen to end up in the underground parking lot for lunch one day because all the other lots you try are full... and you don't want to pay $35 or whatever the obscene downtown maximum is... you might apply for a library card right here and get your parking validated... (although I didn't tell you that...)"
Something for artistic Houstonians on their way to enlightenment! A must see experience in the heart of soulful 3rd ward!
"Project Row Houses is one of our city's fine gems. It took me a long time to finally come see these houses. Finally getting to experience the Artist rounds made me sorry I had never attended earlier. ,The installations are really amazing. Creativity runs wild here--which is something that I think everyone should experience seeing. Sadly, I think this is one of those places that everyone has heard of but never seen. So if you're in that boat--get over there!"
"First go into the visitor center to get a ticket with your booking time. Try to line up early as security takes about 30 mins to enter. The tour is free and totally worth it. ,My fiancé is a history NUT and to be in the room as our founding fathers was a crazy feeling. Do it!"
"One of those tourist destinations that you should see at least once!  Yes I'm sure there are better views elsewhere but go at least once. ,We decided to do lunch at the Sky City restaurant which includes the observation deck and a free picture (about $25-30 per adult) . You'll probably need to stop for lunch in the area anyway so for us this made the most sense."
"As with any large tunnels, you will have to pay a toll to drive in it.  It is an old and long tunnel.  Even in non-rush hour, it can be slow due to it's narrow design and mostly idiotic drivers.  It does offer a short cut across the Bay, so it's worth the cost unless you have to do a daily commute.  I happen to have an EZ Pass, so my toll experience is better than most since all I have to do is drive in and out of the EZ Pass lane."
"Only writing about the monument not the person.,Getting there can take some effort. If you're walking, the monument is on the (far) South-Eastern side of the Tidal Basin, away/across from the National Mall. Not a bad walk along the sidewalk by the tidal pool, but many people will find it too far, like if you have little kids or difficulty walking, I know the because I heard them complaining.,If you are driving the closest parking spots are wedged between the highway (395) on Ohio Drive SW, where you can park (free) and as you face the Potomac River, walk to your right (Westerly) under the highway, and you could stop a check out the lesser known George Mason Memorial as you turn to your Right and walk (North and East) on East Basin Drive SW, and your at the JM after about less than a 1/4 of mile.,As to the description of the Monument see the photos along with this listing. The entrances to the gifts shops and restrooms and exhibits inside the basement are below/under the stairs that lead up to the podium where the state of TJ stands inside. You may notice the Jefferson's figure faces toward the Washington Monument obelisk located to the North across the Basin. ,For fun, find a stranger a start a debate about which of two got the better monument and who was a better President, or person, or not. IMO the better monuments are on the Mall.,IMO the attractiveness, for lack of a better word, of this structure is actually best experienced across the Basin looking at Memorial, along with the reflection, either in the morning or evening or when the cherry blossoms are in bloom."
"Fast and easy, came in on Friday at 3:30 left at 3:50. Thought it was gonna take a lot longer but I guess it depends on what time you come in."
"Amazing place. Great service and super helpful. There were 2 security guards (both were kind, funny and helpful); one even called to the back for me to see if the documentation I had to request a replacement card for my daughter was sufficient. I went there after 1p and expected to have a long wait, but I was in and out in 15 mins."
"I passed by the Waterwall almost every weekend growing up and never actually got the chance to visit. I was in the area on Thursday and finally got a chance to check out the mystical/magical structure.,I decided to live the thug life and park in the Williams Tower driveway, but security came looking for after about 15 mins. I wish there were free parking close by, but you have to pay to park in the parking garage. ,The park area is really nice actually. I would love to go back and have an evening picnic when I have more time. There are several benches along side the path leading up the Waterwall. ,The Waterwall itself is just beautiful to observe and the sound of the water is relaxing. It's impossible not to sing ""Wonderwall"" when you're here!"
Great spacious and commonly hosts events for the locals that are a blast
"Interesting nooks and crannies for what's normally a public park - I go here many years for the Movement music festival, and it works great for having several stages, seating areas, and food sections. Seems odd for anytime it's not a paid, gated event - I'd be creeped out that someone would jump out and rob me in one of those selfsame interesting nooks & crannies. ,Nice view of the water, though!"
"It's a government agency, so you've got to make it a day trip. You don't run in and out of any government agency. With that in mind, the service was so speedy. The workers were efficient and quick without losing their personable and pleasant behavior. As long as you make sure you have everything required, you'll be taken care of with a smile and as quick as they can possibly go. If you don't, then you're gonna give yourself a headache and everyone else as well. So just make sure you're prepared. It also get's pretty hot in there so don't wear a ton of layers that can't be removed."
Best Stadium in baseball.  Always will remember my mother's uncle's season tickets seats behind home plate. Nothing like a game at Fenway.
"I'm sorry, my memories and familiarity with this park won't allow me to give it any less than 5 stars. Come to think of it, I can't remember a time when I didn't know Fenway. My parents started carting us to games at a very young age and I've been going ever since to support my Red Sox Nation. Sure, the seats are small and definitely uncomfortable. And yes, there are obstructed views, especially in the right field grandstand. (We love the Bud Deck.) The prices for beer, food and beverage are astronomical. But all of that doesn't compare to the feeling you get when you watch an exciting action packed game or fun-filled concert at ""America's Most Beloved Ballpark"". The unofficial 'Cathedral of Boston' is always alive with it's famous Green Monster and a must see for all baseball fans & history aficionados alike."
"This is a fantastic place to get a sense of old Miami and the people who were influential in shaping it. The gardens and waterfront were stunning. It was a little hard to get full views of everything in the house, as it was cordoned off for limited access due to the delicate nature of the artifacts contained in each room, and no photography was allowed inside, so that was a downer. But outside, in the garden and waterfront areas, this place shines like a polished gemstone. It took enormous wealth to craft a place like this. It's rich in detail and history. This is a good place to spend a couple of hours if you want to understand old Miami."
"Once upon a time I HAD to take the MAX. Those days are over, but as I was looking at my schedule today and realized that all of my appointments were in the Plaza, I decided that for nostalgia's sake I would once again ride some public transit.,Now, in other cities I LOVE LOVE LOVE public transit, and I wish we had a better system here in KC.  But alas we don't, so I learned to make due with what we have. Fortunately, living in the River Market, the MAX line was virtually right outside my door, and it travels through most areas I at all care about: downtown, the Crossroads, the Plaza, and even into Brookside and Waldo. I didn't really have to deal with the Metro system as a whole. ,Today's ride was great. Sure it took me a lot longer to get to where I needed, but I got to spend about 25 minutes each way jamming to tunes off my iphone and reading a book that i'm currently obsessed with. When your days are packed, packed, packed, it's a nice way to break things up.,The buses are clean, and while full of characters are still quite safe. Also, the MAX at least is generally right on time.,I feel for people who live in less accessible areas of town, or who have to get places outside of the system's limited hours. For them the system may very well be 2 star. For me, however a trip on the MAX is decidedly A-OK!"
"Whilst venturing around the downtown SF area, we just had to make a stop at City Hall. This place was not hard to find, but finding parking nearby is a pain in the neck. We lucked out, and found parking adjacent to the building as someone was pulling out. ,Getting in here involves having to go through a metal detector. Once through, we were free to roam the large place and it's two stories. There were several displays, including a scale model of the building, a heart shaped panel of names of same-sex married couples, a big Christmas tree, and holiday decorations. Somewhere here is the office of the mayor, but due to the fact that we were here after normal business hours, he was not home. The hallways that make up the first and second floor are great to walk around, although just about all doors found along the hallways are locked. ,The best sight within this place is the giant Christmas tree. It is decorated pretty well, and provides a beautiful centerpiece in an otherwise boring interior. The outside of the building is decorated in different lighting schemes, depending on the time of year or the occasion. There is a large lawn in front of the building, and there are many hippy groups always protesting or just loitering here.,I'd recommend checking this place out during the holiday season."
"I made it finally. What a special spot in many ways. Don't miss checking the small museum and souvenir shops underneath!,Price: Free.,Parking: Hmmmm. You should park on streets or garages around Smithsonian and walk here. I walked from the top of Arlington cemetery . It took about 1 hour. I saved money and worked out well.,Special: Many people take special shots here. Wedding, fashion, etc... On the stairs facing the Washington monument."
"Inspired by the African American artist John Biggers, this is a fantastic project borne out of the belief that art and activism can revitalize neighborhoods while preserving their character. The neighborhood is an African American one that has seen some difficult times, and has not reaped the benefits of Houston's gentrification. The project attempts to build community and serve as a catalyst for change, in part through art. You can walk through a line of old row houses serving as galleries for temporary installations - the artists are apparently invited to do an installation then given free reign. There are murals and other art all over the place outside. , In addition to the art, Project Row Houses has done cool stuff like teach kids to garden and provide housing and parenting classes to low income single mothers.,It's free, and it's great, and you should check it out.,Also check out, within walking distance, the Dupree Sculpture Garden, the ""Field of Vision"", and the   unrelated but nearby Flower Man house. Bring a camera.,Row House flickr set: "
"This is a historical building that has been through earthquakes and fires, but still remains an icon of Los Angeles' treasures in the downtown area.  Today, there was much going on with road construction, civic events, pedestrian traffic and other distractions that made a 7-minute trip from J-town into a 15-minute steeplechase through the streets of Los Angeles.  At first, I was planning on street parking, but to my surprise, parking is only $1 on weekends; such a deal (Yiddish accent)!  Once inside, there are several stories, as in floors of books, references and history, to name a few.  Angelenos of all backgrounds could be found reading, researching and perusing books that stimulate the mind, and for me, a ""Study-Guide for my daughter taking a civil service exam.  It never ceases to amaze me how much our public libraries have to offer.  With many venues charging several dollars for entrance, having the enjoyment of reading all day in a historical building with fancy restaurants for lunch or dinner a stones through away is the best deal in Los Angeles."
"Great place for a photo op.  Without being on a tour, you'll need to take pics from across the street for the best view"
"Biggest MUST SEE IN PHILLY. Yes, I am screaming this at the top of my lungs because it is simply amazing. To see where our country's Founding Fathers signed, sealed, and delivered both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution put me in an AWWW state. I am simply put one of the biggest history nerds ever to say the least. I am not going to sit here and say I know anything and everything, but I do enjoy learning about history and this was probably the biggest highlight of my trip to Philly. For me to simply be in the presence was a little piece of heaven for me.,NPS rangers are in the Hall giving specific details of the history of the building and what had roam these halls since its consecration in the mid 1700s. Independence Hall has seen a lot. It has also been remodeled and reconstructed over the last 300 years all of which you will learn here.,One thing I'd like to mention that I got to experience -- I met the innkeeper of Independence Hall and a young Mr. Thomas Jefferson circa 1774. That was a memorable experience in itself. OK, so let me explain...,My friends and I had just finished the tour on the inside and the place was closing. I walked outside to find these 2 gentleman in period garb... colonial times and all. I loved Mr. Jefferson's red hair. Our 3rd president was a fierce redhead back in the date and this actor was sporting his redhead wig with pony tail and all. I sat on the bench and started speaking to them about the Independence Hall. They never broke character. It was only my friends, myself, and the 2 of them. It was so neat and I enjoyed speaking to them.,This is the kind of stuff you're going to run into when visiting here, and I can't wait to return. Mind I mention Mr. Jefferson was a dashing look lad... the actor of course."
"Don't spend $19 to visit the observation deck for this view. The view is wonderful, but the best bang for your buck is to dine at Sky City Restaurant, in particular during lunch to save the most. Lunch is not too pricey and the food is decent, but the view is included!,Once you're at the top, you will get a 360 view of Seattle and surrounding smaller cities, using binoculars you will get a clearer view, especially if you have bad vision like me. ,You also get a free photo with those weird backgrounds, but it's free, so why not?,Very touristy spot, but not too busy in comparison to other tourist spots like Willis Tower or Empire State Bldg.,Definitely a must while in Seattle. I will admit, the best view I found in the city was at Kerry Park... this view will include the Space Needle and all of Seattle and it's free! Check it out!"
"Lol... who the pup yelps about a tunnel? I don't get it.,But if you have to know...The Baltimore Tunnel is only 2 bores or 2x2 lanes.  It takes you out to I-895.  I remember as a kid that the Baltimore Tunnel was the only tunnel at one point.,I prefer the Baltimore Tunnel because I get to use I-895 which is more scenic than the more urban I-95 route that the McHenry Tunnel takes you. Although there is more risk of getting into a jam with the Harbor Tunnel, with the advent of traffic apps on phones and GPS, you can check which route is better before you get stuck.,There you go, my 20 cents (inflation)!"
"This and the Lincoln Memorial are my go to when I'm in DC. If it's not busy, it's a very serene and peaceful place. Good place to take a book and kick back, or just sit and reflect while taking in the surroundings. One of the must's when in our nation's Capitol."
"Guilty: I double majored in Economics and History...but upon arrival at this monument, I realized I had no idea, off the top of my head, as to what made Thomas Jefferson famous...I had to do some Googling afterwards...apparently after returning from France, he introduced America to Mac & Cheese! I LOVE MAC & CHEESE!!!!! ,For such a large building, the statue is actually quite small in comparison. Seems like they should have built a smaller building, or a much much much bigger statue for the great man who brought us Mac & Cheese!,Murrica!"
"I'll review the Tag Office & driver's license office in one post, as they go hand in hand if you're registering a vehicle from out-of-state. 4 stars for Tag Office- 2.5 for Driver's License office. First, thanks to many Yelpers whose posts guided me through the Driver's license experience. Don't  wait till the last minute, you only have 30 days!  I waited till the last week and made it, just barely. You can't really avoid registering your car because the state will find out through your car insurance company. Once you switch to coverage in Georgia, the 30 day clock  starts running. The ins. co. is required to electronically upload your record to the state record, that's how they get you!!! You will have to pay a % penalty after 30 days. For our two cars, that would be an additional $800!"
"This place has to be hands-down one of the most efficiently run government agency office I've waltzed into. ,Having been to ones in California and Washington, I can safely say that New York has got it's isht together. ,FIRSTLY, the building is literally a 2 minute walk from the train station directly off of the 2/3/A/C line, so it doesn't really get more convenient than that (also just a couple of blocks from the N/R if needed).,SECONDLY, the facilities are spacious and clean, and the security staff will guide you if you need directions.,The office itself is, as everyone else has stated, on the 3rd floor. Take the last set of elevator banks on your right hand side. Check-in at the kiosk near the entrance, and save time by printing and filling out the applications beforehand on the handy SSC website.,Grab a ticket number and wait. I waltzed in at 9AM and waited no more than 5 minutes before having my number called. The woman at the window was polite and efficient and filed my replacement card papers in roughly 10 minutes, give or take.,The easiest form of ID to bring is probably your U.S. Passport if you've got one, just FYI!"
"To people who complain about the homeless asking for money - find me a park or outdoor public space in any major city, that DOESN'T have this happening.  It's a city...that's how it goes.,Hart Plaza is such a great spot, it hosts countless free festivals throughout the warmer months, and even when there is nothing going on, HP is a great place to just walk through with friends or your dog, cool off with the mist from the fountain, enjoy the view of the Detroit River.  There's cool sculptures and statues, and a nice view any way you turn.  ,I gotta say that the city keeps Hart Plaza pretty clean too...there may be litter the day or so after a festival ends, but it's picked up quickly and on the average is trash/litter free.,One of the great spots of Detroit."
"Ah yes. The most famous place to take prom pictures. Do girls ever realize that water splashes everywhere? Do they not care that their makeup gets all smudged and their face is sprinkled with water. Do these teenage kids not care if their fancy clothing get wet? Naww I'm sayinn? I guess not. If you're still friends with some youngsters, just watch. Your facebook newsfeed will be filled with prom photos at this famous place. No lie. It's kind of cute though. Lowkey. Kind of wish I did that when I went to prom.,It's a nice place to take out of towners. There's lots of international people that come here to take pictures....in....front.......of..a....fake waterwall. Like, I mean, to each their own, right? But hey, it's a nice place, do doubt. Even on a hot blazing day in the summer of Houston, this wouldn't be a bad place to stop by. ,There's a huge lawn where some kids can play football or couples having picnics. I mean it's also a nice date spot as well."
"I can't believe that is government agency. I was shocked and amazed how well this organization functions and how helpful people are.  ,Just 18 hours before my departure to Europe I have found out that I can't check in. After calling Arline (United) I have found out that I can not check in since my passport is not valid for more than 3 months. They were able to sell me tickets knowing that passport is expiring but now when I'm  trying to check in, they flag me... But that's a separate story. ,Apparently most countries around the world require traveler to have valid passport 3-6months from the departure date. Long story short I was traveling in August and my passport was expiring in October what caused all the trouble. ,I got hold of emergency line consul in Washington DC who scheduled appointment for me next day at noon in order to get new passport. I have arrived at the Chicago location around 7am and waited till the door opens at 8am. Afer quick processing one of the clerks asked me to come back in an hour.  When I came back around 9:15, to my disbelieve passport was ready and still warm ( fresh out of the printer) . I can't stress enough to how great this place is , they saved me a lot of stress, I made to my scheduled flight and my vacation was great :-) . Thank you great people of Chicago passport agency. ,Words of advice:,Prepare your paperwork in advance and triple check for mistakes ,Get your pictures done. ,Bring cash, credit card and check to pay ( 60 bucks extra for expedited passport = total of 170),Print your boarding pass / proof of flight and or traveling documents ,Relax, these people know what they are doing :-)"
"Iconic Baseball Stadium built in 1912 but kept in pristine condition. ,We sat in center field about 5 rows from the top but we did not seem that far from the field.,I loved the consession stands in the right field area with the awnings that made everything so quaint. ,Gotta love of course the ""Green Monster"" and the surrounding area shops, merchants and eateries. ,One of the great experiences you will have if you like baseball and stay around at least until the 8th Inning so you can join into singing Sweet Caroline.,I had a Tasty Burger and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. ,If you are into sports make sure you make it to Fenway Park."
"Spent a good 2.5hrs here. And it was well worth it. The Manor itself is highly detailed. And the gardens are a must see. I was a bit disappointed that the pool was destroyed from a hurricane but hopefully the reconstruction will be done when I come back. Best sightseeing place in Miami for adults and kids! ,Free for military and discounts at the gift shop!"
"Ya gotta love a bus stop called Petticoat Lane.,This is a review of the MAX and it is damn good.  That is not saying it is like a subway or even a light rail (in fact I think it is faster and more efficient than some newer 'light rails')-- in any case I wuz in the country club plaza area, bought a $3 day ticket, and got to go Union Station/Crown Plaza, then Downtown. ,The MAX system is easy to use, and I even used it to go 'round to different spots in Downtown.  Like you would on a small subway, but just a bus overground.   Why walk.  ,I'm from outta town, I know nothing of KC, but I have been to plenty of cities around North America, (believe me--too many which suck at being cities--KC rocks at being a city) and you should be proud of the MAX system, and use it.  Like I said I made stops along the way, but 22 min to go from country club plaza to downtown, that ain't bad."
We went to a wedding here a few years ago and it was beautiful! It's always a good place to go when there are big events happening in SF. Dreamforce was held here a couple years ago and it was a lot of fun. Worth checking out!
"I've always dreamed of getting married in a gorgeous place with a huge staircase, like something from a Disney movie.  So after exhausting our options in SF, my husband asked me where I've always imagined getting married at.  I quickly responded City Hall.  The reason I had never mentioned it was because of the cost.  It's expensive (unless you just hold the civil ceremony there, which is free).  My husband crunched some numbers and after all of the hidden costs for security etc etc knew we couldn't afford it.  However, he found out that we could pay less to rent out the space for 2 hours for a private ceremony, which is what we did.,Our interactions with the office staff were rather disappointing.  It took a long time for email correspondences and to get answers when we had questions.  For the price you pay, you would think you'd receive better customer service, but I didn't care.  I just really wanted to walk down the aisle at City Hall.,On the day of, the staff were surprisingly really nice.  One of them offered me water as I waited to walk down the aisle.  He was a savior at that point, since I had forgotten to eat lunch and was incredibly thirsty.  He even found me a chair to sit down on while the bridal party procession took place.  Everything went smoothly and the venue was exactly what I wanted.  It was stunning, and nearly every guest commented on the beauty of SF City Hall.  Would I pay that amount of money again?  Definitely!  This building is one of the most breath-taking sites of San Francisco.  The grand staircase, the marble floors, the artistry... It's magnificent.  It was my dream wedding come true."
"I will admit that initially I didn't really find the Jefferson Memorial that much interesting to go to at all. Growing up, either from watching too much TV such as the Simpsons (episode where Lisa goes to Washington & coming across a problem, wants to tell her problems to Lincoln, has to head to Jefferson instead since the Lincoln one was packed), the Jefferson Memorial isn't really in print or mentioned much, except maybe in your elementary to middle school American History books (and even then, it's very brief to the point where you forget about it).,Well, as I rounded my way around the Tidal Basin, I finally had the chance to see it up live and personal, and the sight totally blew me away. Standing before me, was a white marble gorgeous Memorial building designed specifically for Jefferson where the architecture of it does not lose in comparison to the one where Lincoln resides. Along the circular room surrounding the white tall sitting statue of Jefferson, there are certain scripture taken from the Declaration of Independence that were contributed by Jefferson and earned him his place in history.,As I stared out into the Tidal Basin from the cool tiled white steps, sitting down and taking a breather, I noticed the beauty of the Washington Monument again throwing its ever-seeing reflection into the clear waters of the Basin, and you notice the little Tidal Basin Paddle Boat Company along the edge of the Basin; I felt a moment of serene peace an you can't help but breathe a sign of content as the breeze blows past you.,Definitely a must-see!"
"Well, one of the still standing Libraries in the Los Angeles area ( its not going anywhere ever). ,Located in the heart of downtown LA this library provides many that still enjoy a good read with great book options. But not only carries books but DVDs, music, and many other items to check out. ,There are two entrances to this library, one on 5th street and the other from Hope st. Just be aware that its a dead end on Hope and you have to walk up stairs to enter. This library has a few floors but its really nicely set up with signs to assist you to head to the right direction. It also has two food options on its street level. A cafeteria and Panda Express which has plenty of seating for all. ,The shelves and books here are well taken care of and nicely maintained. Not too difficult to find what you are looking if you know where to look. Staff here at times is real friendly and helpful. ,I would definitely recommend this library to all, you can walk in here for hours and search tons and tons of books until you find the one for you. Keep in mind there is no parking around here ( cheap parking ) so make sure you come with a plan. ,There are a few parking structures and open space parking on 5th and Olive which is just a block from the library. ,Enjoy and read on!"
"In order to visit Independence Hall, you have to go to the visitor's center the day of to collect tickets. From what I heard, tickets usually are finished being claimed by 1pm-ish, so go early in the morning. Tickets are free, but you need one to visit.,However, without a ticket, you can still visit the two other halls next to Independence Hall and take a short tour (guided by a park ranger) of those. Tours seemed really frequent; like a few times every hour. ,I lucked out and managed to get into Independence Hall without a ticket because there were a lot of no shows. Highly recommend it as it is one of THE most important rooms in US History. The tour itself is pretty short, say 30 minutes or so."
"Absolutely one of the places I'd recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle! ,One of the suggestions I would make would be to get a deal on the Glass Museum and Space Needle together! If you're coming with a group, get a group rate to save a bit more money.,So they'll take you up the elevator and it's gorgeous cause you can see the view and skyline as you go up! Once you get there you can go outside to take photos and they even have a complimentary camera that does a fantastic job of getting the view! I'd recommend coming at night to see all the city lights and such, absolutely gorgeous. ,I took lots of photos to prove just about how beautiful it is! But of course, it's much better in person!"
Wow! What a great tunnel. It has these cool walls that remind me of a pool. The roads through are nice and smooth. And they have free wifi!
"Yo...the walk to this memorial was bananas.,Why it gotta be so far from The Washington/Lincoln Memorial?,Whatevz, it was still such an iconic spot.,Beautiful trees all around it, and the walk around the basin was nice and relaxing.,Tommy J, they really hooked you up with this ginourmous building/tribute, brah."
I was here on a wednesday around 3:30 PM for tag renewal. I waited in line for about 10 minutes and tag renewal itself was only 5 mins. They didn't ask for emission test ( I assume it was already sent to them) and I paid the fee with my credit card. So I can't really complain about anything. Keep up good job.
Reviews are correct very easy! Nice clean office. Competent people. Just look up what you need before. They have applications there but might as well fill out online and bring (with marriage license passport etc). I got there at 7:30 and was done by 8 am. Three minutes of that was the window the rest was waiting. Not bad at all!
"Hart Plaza is the ideal place to hold a festival. It has a large open space for multiple stages and the acoustics are great. And if you find yourself stuck in Canada and the mounties havent beaten you into submission yet you can always swim for it and come up on the other side of North America in Hart Plaza. ,I dont know what that last sentence meant, I havent written a review in a really long time. the end."
"We were passing by the Williams Tower and one of our girls was in amazement at the height and architecture of it. I mean, she was crunk over this building! So, we decided to take a little detour from our route home to take a closer look. Also, the hubbs new about the Waterwall and thought we might get a kick out of that too, which we did.,It's really neat, really tall, and when you're standing there on a hot Houston day, the mist coming off the water is nice and cooling. There is a long grassy knoll-like area between the waterwall and the Williams Tower, for frolicking and picnicking and such.,It was a nice little sightseeing stop on our Saturday afternoon."
Place is great. Just have your paperwork figured out and you'll be fine
"In all honesty, Fenway Park was one of the biggest highlights on our recent trip to Boston.  This magnificent ballpark is an absolute must see, and why I can't say I'm much of a follower of Major League Baseball, you don't need to be to appreciate the rich history of this stadium, which is the oldest in MLB and dates back to 1912.,We came in late October so the chance of being able to see a game was already gone anyway, but I actually wouldn't mind doing that some day, I think to see this stadium alive with fans of the Red Sox would be an experience even for someone that doesn't watch baseball often.  Instead we elected to sign up for one of the stadium tours.,It was really interesting hearing the story of the Red Sox, while being guided around the stadium.  We got to sit in the original wooden seats in the grandstand section, got to visit all of the various upper deck seating areas, including those above what is known as ""The Green Monster"" which contains the original manually operated score board.  Honestly, every time we thought we were as high up as you could get, we go up yet again and hear more history of how new parts and new seating was added to the stadium over time.  It was really fascinating.  Even got to visit the press and media boxes which was really cool.  Talk about some amazing views of the stadium.,Truly this is an amazing stadium and somewhere anyone visiting Boston needs to put at the top of their list of places to visit."
In a city that lacks much in the way of museums or historical landmarks - this is a great place to visit. Highly recommended.
"Another situation where I'm not sure what's to complain about.  As far as city bus systems go (I've ridden buses regularly in four or five different cities) it's not bad at all!  The buses are clean, timely (at least as far as I've noticed), stops are a good distance apart, and the intercom announces stops every now and again.,I haven't noticed any people I would particularly peg as homeless, but even if I did, I can't say I would care - they need to travel as much as anyone else, I would think.  Bus drivers are friendly and people, for the most part, leave you alone.,I think prices are fair, transferring is convenient.  What more can you ask?"
"San Francisco City Hall - I was invited to be the witness of a very spontaneous wedding of a friend of mine, and gosh, that place is beautiful. From the outside - impressive and one of the city's landmarks. On the inside - even more gorgeous. There are no words that can describe the beautiful views you get from every single angle, and the thankfulness you'll feel when you're standing on the wide stairs.,Thankful for the city to host such a wonderful landmark, and in my case, thankful for being the wedding witness.,More to come!"
"So beautiful. I had to do something touristy while on a work trip to DC, and the night of my departure I had some time to kill so a few friends that are local to the area took me to the memorial, as one of them had never been before. Getting to the memorial itself is not the easiest, as it's located across the basin from the Mall. The parking lot seemed a little sketch (especially at 8:30pm on Sunday) as it's set a good distance away from the Memorial. Despite this, the Memorial is a solid five stars. Loved it!,The walkway/sidewalk is wide and is winding along the path up to the memorial. Be mindful at night that there are no lights along the path, but enough ambient light from the city and light from the Memorial come through to make it dark, but not pitch black. It's a 10 minute walk if your pace is leisurely, but I didn't mind it. ,As you approach  the Memorial from the pathway, you come up along the side, and it's just breathtaking. It's expansive, with the statue of Mr. Jefferson in the center, with some of his most famous quotes etched on all ""sides"" of the circular building. There were only a small handful of people in the Memorial itself, and there is a small sign that asks guests to be quiet and respectful to preserve the air of reflection. It evoked a lovely sense of calm, reflection and reverence in me, and it's probably one of the most beautiful monuments I've experienced.,Upon entrance, there is a mall information center to the left, and a gift shop and restrooms to the right. Info and the shop were both closed that late and night, but I would encourage anyone to go at night. The views across the basin to the mall are lovely with all the lights, and the stark lightness of the memorial against the night sky is not to be missed."
"Such grandeur and magnificence. ,The art, the garden, and the structure are simply amazing.,This library is well organized and the staff was so helpful; they genuinely showed a concern for assisting guests in finding what they need."
"Amazing!,1) The tour is excellent. ,2) It is free. ,3) Get ticket from visitor center."
"Up, up, up and away! The tour starts with walking uphill to the side door. This is somewhat steep so be prepared if you have any sort of disability or difficulty. As you go inside, you'll continue walking up a circular hall in which is at an incline. The walls are interactive with this history of the needle, which was built for the world's fair. It was once the largest building west of the Mississippi-- it's not the 7th tallest.... in Seattle! ,Once you get to the top, you're asked to take a photo. I declined and told it was free, which it really is, as you get an email with the photo and you get to choose your backgrounds once on top. You will then get in a glass elevator with about 20 other site seers-- some don't mind being up close and personal, others will try to shrink their body as if they have a shell to crawl into. The elevator person, generally a young girl named Britney or Kelly, will tell you all about the needle in the 42 seconds in which it takes to get to the top. The ride is quick and can make you feel a little nervous about what exactly you're doing. If anyone is going to the restaurant they will drop them off and you get to see the rotating floor of the restaurant which is pretty cool. ,Alright, we reached the top! Doors open and you step into a fun filled piece of history. Grab a cup of Joe from the coffee shop, and walk around taking in the history and interactive history they have. On one wall you have this wall of a computer screen which you can move with your fingers and shows you where people live that have visited the needle, which is all over the world! You can add yourself to the wall using the Kiosk located nearby. ,Take a few steps and you are outside on the balcony, which goes all 365 degrees around. You get views of the whole city. They have built in binoculars there for you to look at. We pointed in into down town and WHOA! Looked right into someone's bedroom-- unfortunately, they weren't home :) jk,Slide your ticket into the camera slot up there and you're given a photo of you with the real downtown as your background. I have attached ours-- the rain messed ours up a little, but it's all in the experience, right??? Go back inside to the kiosk, scan your ticket and email yourself your photos! Get back on the elevator and down you go. No walking downhill this time-- you get released right into the, you guessed it, gift shop when you can get some needlelicious chocolate! ,Is it the best attraction in the world? No! In Seattle... NO! But it's a must see. It's a piece of history, it's fun, and it will allow you to marvel over its beauty. It has the biggest NUTS I've ever seen!"
The tolls are to damn high $4 bucks and you only can pay with cash. I think all the taxes and tolls in Maryland I am thinking of moving down south. That is why I like being down south no tolls and cost of living is cheaper Georgia or Florida here I come.
"Legends never die, they live forever. The late Thomas Jefferson is a legendary man. He was the archetypal Renaissance Man. In his lifetime; he was an architect, musician, political philosopher, book collector, horticulturist, inventor, one of the drafters of the Declaration of Independence, and third President of the United States of America from 1801 to 1809. The Thomas Jefferson legacy lives in the Jefferson Memorial. ,   The Jefferson Memorial is on 2.5 acres along the Southeast shoreline of the Tidal Basin. The designers purposely planned the Jefferson Memorial to be exactly south of the White House and Washington Monument. As a matter of fact the 19 foot high bronze  statue of Thomas Jefferson is looking directly at the White House. With that said, the views of the White House, Washington Monument, Tidal Basin, and Washington D.C. from the Jefferson Memorial are second to none. It just takes some effort climbing up all the marble steps to reach the rotunda. One of my dearest moments in Washington D.C. was watching the sundown over the Tidal Basin from the rotunda.,   Thomas Jefferson was a man who had a way with words. His famous quotes are displayed on the four panels of the interior walls. They tell a story of a legendary man who strongly believed in democracy, freedom, and education. Reading his words were inspirational. Just as touching as Thomas Jefferson's words is the memorial dedicated to him.,  The Jefferson Memorial is down the shoreline from the FDR Memorial. The two men's bonding goes beyond the shoreline connecting their memorials. FDR respected Thomas Jefferson and paid his respect with the idea of the Jefferson Memorial. J.R. Pope designed it in 1936 with Neo-classical architecture. The circular dome is influenced by the Pantheon in Rome. Fast forward a few years to 1943, and FDR paid the ultimate compliment to Thomas Jefferson with the opening of the Jefferson Memorial. ,   It was on our first full day in Washington D.C., where I visited the Jefferson Memorial and back in 1984 on a school field trip. Anyways the Jefferson Memorial was  the last landmark we saw on a tour of the memorials and monuments on the West National Mall and Tidal Basin shoreline. The walk from the FDR Memorial to the Jefferson Memorial added to the experience. The Jefferson Memorial is a mesmerizing site reflecting on the Tidal Basin. With each step forward on the treeline walking path on the shore the Jefferson Memorial became closer and more spectacular. We'd take in scenes of paddle boats and geese enjoying life in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson. In my opinion, if you have a few days in Washington D.C., I highly recommend a walk along the Tidal Basin to the Jefferson Memorial instead of being dropped off there. Fortunately we caught the Jefferson Memorial when the sun was transitioning to night over the Tidal Basin and beyond (I think Thomas Jefferson would like photography). This was the ultimate conclusion to a day touring the sights of Washington D.C.,   Legendary people never die. Thomas Jefferson lives on in the Jefferson Memorial."
The dumbest people I have ever had to deal with. A trained monkey could do a better job.
Very well organized and sufficient office! I was in & out within 30 minutes. I'm very impressed!!! Do yourself a favor and just come to this office and get your business done quickly!
"Great park, refreshing from the hustle and bustle of the city, nice view of the lake and parts of Canada."
"This place is cool! It's a waterfall in downtown, and it's man-made. On a hot day, this would be the perfect place to visit, because the spray from the waterfall cools you down. I would definitely recommend a visit! There's free parking at a lot nearby as well."
"Loved it!,My friend lives across from here so I'm not sure how parking would be but I imagine it would be a nightmare. ,It's very cool inside both temperature and aesthetic."
Great service and people working here! Put on your patience cap because it's a process but it's a good one! Well done!
"Fenway is probably one of the if not the most historic stadium in all of the U.S. The place really has the game of baseball down to a science and they know how to keep the crowd engaged. Having been to several stadiums around the U.S, Fenway continues to top the list, not because of their awesome amenities or modern atmosphere but because of the fans, the ambiance and the historical nature of this place. I'd recommend hitting up a Sox game to anyone living in or visiting the New England area. ,Pros-,Historical ,Ambiance ,General feel ,Green Monstah ,Concessions ,Location ,Cons-,Outdated compared to most ,Small narrow aisle ways"
"Vizcaya Museum and Garden is a palace. It was my second time visiting and it was as beautiful as I remembered it.  I am so happy that I was able to take my parents this time.  We walked through the inside of the rooms, and it was wonderful to see all of the different artifacts and the home fully adorned with impeccable detail.  It is hard to believe this home is over 100 years old.  I guess you can really tell from elevator that we rode up for my mom. ,I love how this is built on Biscayne Bay. The views are just extraordinary throughout. Can you imagine living in this home with the view? ,My favorite part was seeing the huge iguana walking around by the water. He was so big and beautiful, and I swear, it was used to having the paparazzi take pictures of him. Imagine an iguana posing for pictures.,If you are a garden lover, you will be so impressed with the huge Vizcaya Garden. I wish to see it when the flowers are fully bloomed because I was there in the winter, which don't get me wrong, there's really not much of a winter in Miami, but still.,This place is a dream for anyone who loves nature, loves photography, loves the essence of feeling like royalty in a palace.  ,I am so happy that I have been able to see this place twice, and it is should definitely be a place on your must see list."
"The metro shows that Kansas City is lacking in public transit. Unfortunately, it is my only option to get to work. The early morning routes are ok, they are usually close to being on time, and fairly safe. The big problem is anytime after about 11:00am. The buses will always be at least five minutes late, usually more. It is hard to even feel safe on the bus. I have experienced people arguing with the driver and yelling at other passengers. It is also almost impossible to ride the bus in Kansas city without someone trying to sell you something, movies, music, cell phones, or pot. The Metro buses are usually dirty, and smell like a mix of old food and body odor.  I know that the area I work in is in a terrible neighborhood, but I would at least like to feel safe at the bus stops, but I don't. ,I will say that the bus the runs near the Plaza, westport, and Crown Center areas is a little better, but not much."
"I literally have no experience here except walking by it to take a few photos, but... it's awesome. I always love seeing city halls and this one is stunning!"
"The Jefferson Memorial is a breathtaking memorial on the Tidal Basin that gets most of its visitors during cherry blossom season when the flowers and the people abound. I've never visited during cherry blossom season and although I know all the people would drive me crazy, the photos look SO PRETTY I just have to come back one day.,The memorial is massive with large marble columns around the building. I love how the temperature drops a few degrees when you walk inside the memorial. The statue on the middle is beautiful and it is surrounded by quotes from Jefferson on the walls. This memorial is a bit of a hike, but it is worth it. You can walk around the Tidal Basin to see the FDR Memorial and the MLK Memorial too."
"My complaint about the Los Angeles Public Library has to do more with their programs, in particular their reading/speaker programs. The writers that they feature are generally mainstream writers, funneled in by the big publishing houses as part of their promotion. Where are the local writers? Where are the minority writers?,In contrast the San Francisco Public Library partners with minority groups so they have vibrant programs that include Asian Americans, Filipino Americans, Black Americans, and so on.,I'm hoping that the Los Angeles Public Library can have more programs showcasing local talent and minority writers. This library ought to serve its constituency in the first place, and not just be part of the marketing ploy of big publishing houses."
"Visiting Independence Hall is a humbling experience. It is wonderful that the birthplace of the Revolution and the United States of America is maintained in such fantastic condition and manned by such enthusiastic rangers and guides. It's extraordinary to see where everything began so many, many years ago. ,You'll need to pick up (free) tour tickets from the Independence Visitor Center beforehand or reserve them online via the National Park Service for a small fee."
"We toured at night. Before you tour, you could walk all around the gift store, there is a huge variety of memorabilia  that you could choose from. To start your tour you walk a windy stair case and security will check bags. ,Once you pass security you could tour pics of how they made the space needle. Before heading up you will take a picture then ride up the elevator. ,Upstairs you are able to see how many people ever visited space needle and have a beer or snacks up there. Walk around outside and check out the scenery. ,A must visit place but I suggest going up during the day."
What do you really say about a Tunnel? $4 is alittle high I though. Better than some Tolls and fees in NY
"One of my favorite tunnels -- always a treat to use it!  Yes it is an older tunnel and therefore much narrower than more recently-built tunnels, but that is just fine with me.  The tiles are almost always very clean, which affords a lot of safety benefits. A leisurely cruise to the tunnel from I-95 northbound via I-895 is a real treat, and there are rarely many cars on that stretch."
"Definitely the most breathtaking memorial in my opinion. From the ginormous statue to the script on the walls, it's truly a sight to see. ,Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"Believe it or not, but I actually look forward to coming here. It's become part of how I celebrate (read: acknowledge) getting older. First I get an emission test and then I come here a few days before my birthday. It's amazingly pain free and SO EASY!,In theory it would be even easier to handle this without having to visit an office. For a small fee you can renew your registration by mail. You can do it online for a slightly higher small fee. Normally I'm totally in favor of handling stuff remotely, but for some reason I like getting my tag decal in person.,Maybe it's the adventure you can have Downtown around all the busy government buildings. Maybe it's the quick service I always get here. Maybe it's just a way to save a buck. Whatever the case, I'll gladly go because I appreciate how well this office is managed and I don't feel like I'm wasting my time."
"Went in at 1:35pm on a Friday.. When they close at 3pm. So really risky. ,BUT was pleasantly surprised. I was out and processed within an hour and there was quite a good amount of people there before me. ,Honestly the DMV was faster around 34th.. But that was ridiculous in the sense I was in and out there in 15 minutes so in my head they deserve 6/5 stars and the SS deserves a solid 5/5. ,Good job!"
"Another great place to visit in the heart of the ""D"" Whether you want to enjoy the beautiful downtown, or your at Joe Louis or Cobo make sure to go to Hart Plaza.  It is right along the Detroit Waterfront and near the Detroit Princess, great to spedn the afternoon or to just take some pictures!"
"Recently took a trip to Houston for the first time and looked into places not to miss. Apparently this wall of water is the #1 photographed landmark in all of Houston. Shocker, we added to that statistic. However the Houston couple we met at the hotel had not heard of it! I would check it out if you're in the area. Pretty cool site, plus when your close up you get a little breeze and mist which is a nice break from the Houston heat!"
"All I can say is THANK YOU to all of you who went here to review this place...really reviewing the entire procedure.  I am such a rule follower that I was convinced, after talking to numerous government employees, that the only way for me to renew my passport in the week-window I had was to drive to Detroit or Minneapolis (7 hours in either direction!) because those were the ""closest"" offices with available appointments.,I suppose if they said walk-ins were welcome they would be swamped.  So again, thanks, to all of you who shared your walk-in success stories.  Mine was much the same.  Got there at 9:20 for the 10:00 opening.  Was ""screened"" and given a cue number by 9:50.  Done with the whole procedure by 10:15.  Since I had a whole week left before my flight I was told my new passport would be ready the next day.  Happy to do that so all of my line buddies who were flying today and tomorrow could get their passports the same afternoon.  So relieved!!!"
"This place is a five... If you have a hard on for baseball history. Without a baseball boner, it's a smaller stadium that has some quirks to it. ,Tip- If you love baseball, make sure you shell out $$ to get good seats- the stadium was designed in 1912 with support beams that prevent you from seeing the pitcher and batter from a lot of seats, and it's a rude surprise if you are an unfortunate soul plagued with one of these seats. ,Definitely get a sausage with peppers- way delicious and a quality $8 spent there. Kettle corn is made fresh and enough to feed a family of four (or one of me) for 6.50. It's still crunchy three days later!,Fenway is kinda a must when you go to Boston, right? Easy to get to- just take the T (subway) to Kenmore. ,For visitors like me- no, you can't go up to the Green Monster unless you have a ticket, and you can't access their ""Hall of Fame""-style exhibit unless you are a season ticket holder. The high schooler scanning your ticket isn't interested in cash bribes or answering how this makes sense at all to not charge people to let them in.,Don't forget to warm up your vocal cords for 8th inning Sweet Caroline, and call Visa to push your credit limit out if you are drinking beer here tonight!"
"I love Vizcaya and have visited many times over the last 20 years.  This most recent trip was sort of nostalgia visit with my Mom and we noted a lot of great changes.  On previous visits, we loved doing the tours with the guides.  This time around, Vizcaya has done a great job of embracing technology.  Audiowands are available for rental and there are over 20+ stops throughout the home and garden.  The audiotour content is EXCELLENT!  Lots of experts about various points of history, décor, and the customs and culture of the time.  There are even sound samples for some areas that include actual performances on some of the historic instruments throughout the home.  This new tour format was just incredible and really made the home and gardens come alive.  It also made for a leisurely stroll and set a great pace for our day.  The home itself is stunning and the rooms are furnished in wonderful period pieces.  Another great feature of Vizcaya is the stunning location on Biscayne Bay.  The weather was nice (but steamy) the day we visited and we took every opportunity to rest on a bench in shady spot and simply drink in the beauty.  This remains one of my favorite historic homes and our recent visit added additional rosy glow to the warm memories I have of childhood visits."
"So it's come to this... You've decided to take the bus. ,Look, Kansas Citians love their cars like they love their barbecue. What that means is that more often than not, public transportation becomes the illegitimate child they made that one time with the chick they met at the Parliament Funkadelic concert. ,I'm not saying you have to pay KCTA's tuition, but it wouldn't hurt you to recognize it once in awhile, you know? ,I take the bus to work everyday. Often, I take it home. It's convenient because my work foots the bill. It's NOT convenient because after 7pm, the MAX runs once every 30 minutes. Since I'm a jackass who works until 7, I get to stand around until 7:25 to meet the evening bus. All in all, it makes for a long evening. This is my primary beef. ,Once, in the dead of winter (we're talking coldest day of the year, folks), the evening bus driver sped past me. This would have been excusable had I NOT BEEN STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL. I jumped up and down and screamed and flailed my arms and cursed God, as I knew it was he who was responsible for my misery. I called the 800 number on the placard and voiced my frustration-- you KNOW I was serious cause I never do that-- and the lady on the other end apologized, but 'axed' me, 'what m'I sposed to do?' Well, you can start by coming down here and picking my ass up, bitch. (is what I didn't say),Other than that, the MAX is pretty alright. ,Sure, there are a lot of smelly people (there is a hilariously disproportionate amount of homeless folk on the KC bus in comparison with any other cities mass-tranist system) but they mostly keep to themselves. In fact, I've never been approached in an unwarranted fashion. These are just people, trying to get somewhere they think they need to be (but probably don't)... You know, the free clinic, the Fast-Stop or another bus-stop."
"The worst to come here and open business you will be online for 50 m to one hour .,All this big place with 2 employes only !!!!"
"I visited the Jefferson Memorial over the weekend on Saturday. It was quite a sight, and is located in Washington, DC near the Washington monument. Its a public monument so there isn't any fee or security you have to worry about. Just some walking from the National Mall. Being the Jefferson Memorial, its dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, one of America's founding fathers.It is surrounded by circular marble steps that lead into a marble dome and in the very middle stands a bronze statue of Jefferson himself. Not much to complain besides it being a bit windy but just dress for the appropriate weather."
"I don't see how I've lived in LA my whole life and never been here. We came for a Ron Finley lecture (guerrilla gardener) and found this place to be absolutely magical. First of all the building is majestic and huge, beautifully preserved in the middle of DTLA. The insides are tricky, there's a lot of rooms, passages, levels, etc. But it's fun finding all the nooks and crannies of this library. They have fun sculptures hanging from the really tall ceilings, old historic picture of DT on the walls of the hallways (which I found just fascinating). Other than the homeless and the crazys wandering and kinda hanging out, making camp there, this place is a wonderful little adventure."
Great tour for learning about how the constitution was developed and the history of independence hall. The tour is free. The place consists of a bunch of small buildings which all have parts of history inside. I was here in the winter and it wasn't crowded. The staff is very knowledgeable and will provide answers to questions and give you a history lesson as you stand and look around. The tour of independence hall was well done and our guide provided a lot of background about the whole building and what went on there to develop the document which would become the foundation of our country. A pretty cool experience to be a part of!
"Has some awesome views but it is pretty expensive. I went in the morning right when they opened and there weren't very many people, I can see how as the day goes on it can get crowded and uncomfortable. It's cool that they have tables at the top so you can just sit and take in the view. It's also pretty cool that you get 2 free souvenir photos. One before you hop in the elevator and one with a view of the city. The elevator host wasn't very welcoming and made things kinda awkward."
"I had the pleasure of visiting the Jefferson Memorial when I went to DC for the Cherry Blossom festival. The Thomas Jefferson Memorial is a presidential memorial in Washington, D.C., dedicated to Thomas Jefferson,he was a drafter and writer of the Declaration of Independence. ,I went there after visiting the National and Lincoln monument and it was the time of sunset. To be honest I was not interested in visiting this place as it was a bit far from the two above mentioned monuments but I decided to give it a go and trust me it was totally worth it. The memorial was not as big as the Lincoln memorial but the night time view that I got was amazing. I took the metro to go to DC as my friends had warned me about the parking situation in DC, it especially gets busy during the festival.,After walking for approximately 10 minutes from the National memorial the sight of the white marble gorgeous memorial building blew me away. The statue of Jefferson was the white tall sitting statue inside the circular room; the walls have certain scriptures taken from the Declaration of Independence, where Jefferson played an important role. The place have restrooms downstairs with a display of Jefferson's life and contribution to the formation of the country. The place was not crowded like the other memorials around it, so it was kind of an escape for me from the crowded hectic day; as I had the chance to enjoy the cool breeze that blew through me while I was sitting in the calm and quiet environment.,If you come to DC or make plans to visit the Lincoln and National monuments make sure to add this monument to your plan."
"I moved a month before my birthday, so I wasn't able to renew my tag online. After taking my car in for its emissions check, I headed to the tag office. Park in a metered space if you can-- the parking lots I saw were a complete rip-off.,If you're changing your name due to marriage, go to the SSA office first, the DDS next, and then the tag office. If you need to change your car title (name and/or address), bring a copy of your marriage certificate and your new driver's license. The title change was $18 and I received my new title in about a week.,Come prepared: They only accept cash and checks."
"Is this the best government office experience that I have ever had? I think so.,I went in with a book because it was lunchtime, in Manhattan, but I didn't even make it two pages into my book. The staff and security personnel were friendly and efficient. Thanks!!"
"*** Free festivals, beauitful fountain, winter ice skating ... ***,What's not to like?  Parking and crowding maybe, but c'mon. ;p,*** Summer festivals soon.  Hope to see one.  Live music rocks! ***"
"Great and free activity to do while in Houston! The Williams Waterwall sits next to a beautiful lush green park where many people picnic or toss the ball around. There is also a great view of the William's Tower which looks beautiful during the sunset. It is a great place to relax and soak in the views, or take pictures for a special event like a wedding or a prom. Park at for free at the Galleria mall, just around the corner."
"This place is fantastic. Kind, clean, and very organized. If you need your passport fast this is the place to go!"
"Easy, fast, friendly, informed, helpful, efficient. Everything I was not expecting from a government agency."
"I mean, yeah, a 5 from this Yankee fan. *cringe*,Oldest ballpark in America deserves the 5 (not for the gross hotdog I had) but for the greatness that is this park. This ballpark reeks of great baseball history and tradition. There is no other place I've been where people are really serious about their team the way the Bostonians are about their Red Sox.,Seats are uncomfortable and where we sat you couldn't see when home runs were hit but man the ambience made up for it. We've had better seats in the past so it's not biggie. ,If you can catch a game here do so! Seeing someone actually manually is actually a treat. Singing Sweet Caroline is must. And seeing the Yankees win there was just the icing on the cake!"
"My boss recommended Vizcaya to me after commenting that this place seemed like it was taken from a different country and I completely agree with her. Now is the perfect time to visit because of the construction going on. For students, the price is $9 each and it was well deserved. The house is huge and bigger than I had expected; even though visitors are not allowed to take picture inside, this does not interfere with the experience. A tip that is worth mentioning is to get to the museum early due to long lines and limited parking in its proximity. However, there is free parking across the street and visitors take a short walk in nature and that is the first of the gardens. The gardens is what makes the place magical; it goes on for miles and it is well taken care of. Words cannot describe how beautiful this experience was. Take your family or loved one and this is the perfect trip!"
"Relied on the Metro for 2+ days to show my mom around KC. We hit up Brookside, SW Blvd, Downtown, Crown Center, W 39th, Art Museums all using the Metro and their $3 day passes. The only buses I am extremely  familiar with are the 47,39 and MAX. We were out and about pretty late  and the system worked like a charm. They could use some higher frequencies on most (if not all) of the buses besides MAX, but people need to stop sleeping on the Metro. It works...Mom liked it and I can't argue with that. Dump your car and take the bus."
"My visit to Vital Records was 15 minutes well spent. ,I'm so glad I came in person vs mailing in my request which would've taken an estimated 10 business days to process ,+ a required notarized application; ,+ a self addressed stamped return envelope ,+ a $30 expedite fee;,IN ADDITION TO the $25 Record Search Fee to produce a certified copy of the Birth Certificate. ,Vital Records is in Rm 162, 1st Flr @ City Hall where Birth / Death certificates are processed while you wait. We were in and out in under 15 minutes, with a certified copy in hand. ,REDUCE YOUR WAIT: ,Download the form online, complete it, and print prior to coming to City Hall. However, do NOT complete part II of the Sworn Statement (page 2), the remaining information must be notarized or completed in the presence of SF County Clerk Vital Records Staff;,BRING VALID GOVT ISSUED PHOTO ID and one of the following METHODS OF PAYMENT: check payable to ""SF County Clerk"", or debit card (pin required), or cash (""exact change"" only);,TIMING IS EVERYTHING: Last fully completed application accepted no later than 3:50pm, Monday through Friday (closed federal holidays). ,ADDITIONAL INFO: ,Email ,Or visit their official site"
"Although the memorial for our third president and primary author of the Declaration of Independence was not completed until 1943, it is more than fitting that this patriot share space with Washington and Lincoln  in the DC National Mall. The open-air design with marble steps and columns is unique, but provides an almost 360 degree view of the imposing 19-foot, five-ton bronze statue placed at its center. On one wall are excerpts from the Declaration. Below the dome, in a frieze, are his words: ""I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."" A wonderful tribute to one of our most cherished and beloved Founding Fathers."
Beautiful library. Super friendly staff behind the check-in counter when getting our library cards and Jack S. in the Science Section was super nice and helpful! Thanks Jack!! Many events going on for free! Validated parking in lot off Flower.
"If you are visiting Philly this is THE historical building that you must visit. You get to stand in the actual room in which the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution was debated and ultimately signed.,First, you must pick up free tickets at the visitors center a block away. Once you pass a security check point next to Independence Hall a tour guide will take you into a room and give you some historical facts. The guide then takes you into an old courtroom first, then the room the documents were signed by George Washington, Ben Franklin and the other founding fathers of the country. The room still contains original chairs, books, quills,  and walking sticks used by our founding fathers.,When the tour ends you can walk into another wing of the building on your own to see old copies of the Declaration and Constitution.,Don't even think about visiting Philly without stopping by Independence Hall."
"$22/adult. I recommend dining at SkyCafe. You have to spend a minimum of $25 pp. You just need to pay a little more to get the view and enjoy a good meal. ,The Space Needle is a historical landmark which we couldn't pass up. The view wasn't amazing due to the weather but I was able to see a lot of the city from way up high. There were many monitors in which you can view photos taken from SkyCafe and views of the city at different times of the day from different days. The inner walls of the Space Needle had information about the Needle and visitors, which was pretty cool. There's also a number of binocular outside. ,I do recommend dressing warm and maybe wear a hat or beanie and even gloves. lol. It's freezing on the outside deck and it's hard to take a good picture with your hair in your face. lol."
Beautiful views of the capital and the cherry blossoms! What a fantastic monument!
"What a gorgeous monument. The Thomas Jefferson Memorial is a bit off the beaten path and not in the general vicinity of the other monuments as you'd assume. For some reason or another, the statue of TJ is eerily sumptuous to me, especially at night when viewing him from afar as he basks in the glow of a many backlight. Gives me chills."
"I almost never write reviews on Yelp, much less for a government agency.  But, what happened on Monday has compelled me to actually login for once and do this.  Bear with me, it is a long one but I am very grateful so must share this story.,I bought a car last December (very close to my birthday), and traded in my previous old clunker in the process.  The old car had very title taxes by the time I bought the new car, so I was shocked by the amount listed on the annual 'birthday tax' I received in the mail for the new car I have now: $438.  ,Sticker shock combined with habitual procrastination, I waited until the day before DVM closes for Christmas and 4 days before my birthday before reluctantly head to the DMV and pay for this abomination.  ,The line was short and efficient, first of all.  When I got to the window, checkbook out and checking account already adjusted and ready to take the hit, the man behind the counter looked at the year of my vehicle and asked, 'did you buy this car from a dealership last year? do you have the bill of sale for this car with you?' to which I thought was odd and answered truthfully, 'no, I did not bring it with me.'  I thought, 'who brings the bill of sale to pay for their tag & title?  seriously?  this dude is nuts.'  Turns out, he was trying to save me some money.  He proceeded to tell me about the New Ad Valorem Title Tax (,), which in short allows you to pay the title tax for you car up front instead of annually.  I did get a flyer in the mail about this, but I did not understand the implications.  ,As it turns out, the amount of taxes I paid on the car at the time of the purchase, plus the tax I had already paid for my previous car before trading it in, was enough for the new car I now own.  But how would I have possibly known that?  This gentleman was not obligated to tell me about it.  But he went above and beyond what is expected of him which most people would have just done the minimum, taken my check and hard-earned dollars and let me go on my way.  ,Instead, he had me call the car dealership, provided the fax number to the DMV office, and looked up my old trade-in's VIN number for me with the limited amount of information I was able to provide to him, had me sign the right paperwork, and multiple steps later, reduced the tax I thought I was in there to pay from $438 to - get ready for this - $20!!!!!!  ,I couldn't believe it.  There are very few times I am impressed by government workers' effectiveness at their job, and even less so by their willingness to help the citizens that go to their institutions to pay for things that us little random nobodies typically do not believe we even have any options other than paying what is asked of us.  But this man completely surprised me.  There are actually good people in this world.,I did not get his name, so Merry Christmas to the DMV at 141 Pryor street, and happy birthday to me =]."
"New Social Security cards are on the 3rd floor, just go straight in and to the SSA through the elevators at the back right of the lobby. ,Laid back bunch of folk working there made the process 2EZ. Picked up the forms, filled them out and got out of it in 10 minutes. ,To be completely fair, the biggest qualm was which seat I would pick for the 20 second wait before getting served - there is a lot of free seating. I chose one on the second row it was quite seat like but I didn't get a chance to get fully acquainted so maybe look for a more complete seat review in another Yelp review., Feeling pretty social secure right about now thanks to 123 William Street."
"Ok..Yeah.  I love Detroit.  Is the park beautiful?  Absolutely.  Is it a five star place?  Well......,There are great festivals, music events, and just everyday strolls by the river.  It's mostly clean and a safe place to be.  I just wish they would do something about the beggars.  ,I can't go down to the park without some one asking me for money.  I even had a guy reach into my sons stroller and hand him a little flag.  After I walked away he approached my husband and asked him for money.  My husband refused and he ran back to me and snached the flag back from my son.  When my son said, ""why?"" the guy said because your Daddy is too cheap.  Really?  I know the guy is harmless but it's just a hassle."
"My husband I were in a complete panic because our passports were still ""processing"" (and they were in New Hampshire) 3 days before traveling. After 5 hours on the phone with the ridiculously unhelpful passport staff, we were finally told that we could try to visit the agency in Chicago. After reading the reviews we had a glimmer of hope.,We arrived at 7:15 and waited with some very stressed out travelers. Everyone there was able to get their passports before the end of the day. They won't let you up to the office until 8:15. I'm guessing you can try to head up around 8:10 but there's a good chance they will send you back to the waiting area. Once you're up stairs they separate the people with appointments and without. We did not have an appointment but were still able to get our passports at 3pm. ,Some words of advice:,-Come prepared with new original copies of your birth certificate and refill out the passport application. You can print them online and they do have them there but make sure they are filled out before you get to the first window. ,-Print out any proof of imminent travel like your flight itinerary.  They try to help people traveling within the next 2 days so if you're a week out, they may suggest you come back closer to your travel date. ,-From speaking with the staff, it sounds like Mondays and Fridays are the most chaotic. If you're not traveling immediately, try to wait for a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. ,All in all, the staff was very helpful and they waved all expediting fees because our passports had been processing for more than 20 business days. So we were able to get our passports, at no additional fee, the same day."
"While spending the day in Houston we decided to stop at the Williams Waterwall before exploring some more of the city. When we arrived we parked at the far end of the park and walked over to the wall. ,The view of the Waterwall was gorgeous and standing in the center of the monument was an incredible experience. We enjoyed the time we spent here and we would recommend this park and monument to anyone visiting the area."
"Wow. Wow. Wow.,It's just an amazing experience for the historical story behind Fenway.,Plus watching Boston Red Sox was super coolllll:)),Tip-parking is a pain"
"I absolutely love Vizcaya - it's a great hidden gem!  ,The house itself is a sight to be seen - each and every room, hallway, staircase was built with such detail and such beauty.  The Museum offers a guided tour but there are signs each step of the way detailing the rooms if you opt to go it alone.  The library is fantastic; showcasing hundreds on books in antique glass cases.  The best view in the house comes from James Deering's master bedroom; views of the barge and overlooking Biscayne Bay.  ,Let's move outside.. stunning!  The views of Biscayne are gorgeous!  Walk out into the gazebo and see water for days and days.. so serene.  We even got to see some manatee swimming past the barge.  The gardens are magnificent; beautifully manicured and very romantic.  Every which way you turn, something else catches your eye.  Beautiful sculptures, flowers, and hidden paths to discover.  I always think about how amazing it would have been to be a kid growing up there and being told to ""play outside""!  I can't wait to visit at night to see the gardens all lit up.. I can only image how great it will look and how everything will just shine!"
"Ok so am I just stupid or is the Kansas City Transit system crap? I think its crap. Not owning a car I have to deal with the system on a regular basis to get from point a to point b. Its either I have to be hours early everywhere or a few minutes late. Most the time I stand and wait at the bus stop and the bus just drives on by like I was supposed to tag it down like a taxi in New York.,Also I noticed that the prices are going up! If you are going to increase prices how about adding more routes and more stops? Kansas City needs to get up with the times. So if you move here with out a car you need to be prepared to spend most of your time trying to get to your destination."
"I'm a structural engineer and people often ask me what my favorite building. Well, hands down San Francisco City Hall. It's just breathtaking on the inside and outside -- the architectural and interior design. I highly recommend visiting if you have not done so. ,It's a multi-use facility so there are city public offices and sam tag working during normal hours, along with photographers, tourists, and soon-to-be-newly weds taking picture all over. ,The fourth floor is my favorite hiding spot. I'm just in love with the way the natural lighting shines through the windows and hits the marble floors and walls.  ,I love my beautiful city. I can't believe I work right next door to this magnificent building. City Hall is absolutely my all time favorite building in the world."
"Only writing about the monument not the person.,Getting there can take some effort. If you're walking, the monument is on the (far) South-Eastern side of the Tidal Basin, away/across from the National Mall. Not a bad walk along the sidewalk by the tidal pool, but many people will find it too far, like if you have little kids or difficulty walking, I know the because I heard them complaining.,If you are driving the closest parking spots are wedged between the highway (395) on Ohio Drive SW, where you can park (free) and as you face the Potomac River, walk to your right (Westerly) under the highway, and you could stop a check out the lesser known George Mason Memorial as you turn to your Right and walk (North and East) on East Basin Drive SW, and your at the JM after about less than a 1/4 of mile.,As to the description of the Monument see the photos along with this listing. The entrances to the gifts shops and restrooms and exhibits inside the basement are below/under the stairs that lead up to the podium where the state of TJ stands inside. You may notice the Jefferson's figure faces toward the Washington Monument obelisk located to the North across the Basin. ,For fun, find a stranger a start a debate about which of two got the better monument and who was a better President, or person, or not. IMO the better monuments are on the Mall.,IMO the attractiveness, for lack of a better word, of this structure is actually best experienced across the Basin looking at Memorial, along with the reflection, either in the morning or evening or when the cherry blossoms are in bloom."
"I love this library. Huge. 3 stories. Even a nice little gift store, which I wrote a separate review about. It has way more books, in the teen section (in my opinion) than any other library I've been to. I tend to find books here, that are hard to find elsewhere.,HOWEVER. PARKING. IS. RIDICULOUS. ,With a library card validation, it's 6 or 9 for the first 3 hours. After that, it's $3.50 EVERY TEN MINUTES. We were shocked to find our parking was $23. Ridiculous."
"One of the many reasons to stop in Philadelphia. This place is located with history to how the Declaration of Independence was signed (housed nearby). Lots of staff to direct you. Free. Parking around can be plenty pricy. Plan for a quick security check. ,Plenty of opportunities to take pictures. A few rooms and nice courtyard outside. A few statutes of important figures. ,Tour guides are very well educated and articulated history of the sites very well.,Overall educational and a good stop"
"If you come to Seattle chances are the Space Needle is on your list of places to visit. It is definitely a major tourist attraction, but is fun for the whole family. ,We bought our tickets in advance online. Our tickets were good for a visit to the Space Needle and to the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum next door. Adult admission for both was $36, which is a reasonable price. ,We came to the Space Needle around 5PM on a Saturday. It was pretty crowded on the ground level. We headed up to the elevator line. The elevator is on the outside of the building and it is glass so you can see outside as you go up to the observation deck. It takes just a few minutes to get from the bottom to the top. When you exit the elevator you are on the inside of the observation level. There are tables throughout as well as food options and souvenir stands. ,We decided to get some adult beverages and stake out a table inside to enjoy the sunset. As it began to get dark we headed outside to the observation deck to get the best panoramic views of the city. A great place for photos! However, it was a bit chilly so if you plan to hang out outside for an extended period of time bring your beanie, scarf and gloves in addition to a down jacket and you will be fine. ,A fun place and definitely a great spot for a date with your significant other!"
"This memorial is dramatic in its own right. Its not as massive as Lincoln, or as ornate at WWII, but it still is a must visit when visiting DC.,Our 3rd President stands tall in the middle of the rotunda, with quotes surrounding him.  We came on a wintery day, so the inside was a bit dim and the surrounding area quite stark.  I'm sure when the cherry blossoms are out, the Memorial is qute beautiful and well lit.,On the Hop on/ Hop off bus, they take you on the back side.  Be sure to Hop OFF so you can see the front."
"BE PREPARED If you are moving from out of state! I was (and still am) in total shock at the $1200.69 I had to pay for my GA Tag (for a 2013 honda accord). I moved from Texas, which I paid $1300 for sales tax last year (in Texas). I own the car (no loan) and was told I could pay half (apprx $601) , but the state would not issue a title until I paid in full!!!!,I AM OUTRAGED! This is the most ridiculous law I have ever heard of. I am a Georgia Native and have been working in Texas for the past 4 years, coming back home and getting this shocker almost sent me into heart attack mode! ,If you are coming from out of state, be prepared! How are most people able to pay this outrageous fee? I have been double taxed, which technically is against the law (i do believe)...,horrible, horrible ""welcome back home""..."
"I thought for sure that I'd be the one to have a bad experience (certainly they can't be THAT good) but am elated to say that the whole process took ten minutes. ,Yep, ten minutes. From the time I got my number to the time I walked out of the door. ,Now if only the DMV could follow suit!"
"Lovely open park with lost of sculptures and statues!,Great views of the water and places to lay and relax in the sun - awesome!"
"What a neat place to check out! There's not much to do other than gawk at the water wall, but it is a nice/serene sight to see and makes for a great photo op. Check it out if you're in the area! Not many locals have even checked it out from my conversations with people, but it was a fun addition to my visit to Houston."
"This is a must see when you come to Miami. The house is amazing and the gardens are absolutely beautiful. Right now they are doing construction on the pool area so we got discounted tickets when we went today ($16 instead of the usual $18). We walked around the mansion and it's awesome, I only wish we were allowed to take pictures inside but I understand their reasoning. If you want to spend an extra $5, you can go on a guided tour but we opted not to. ,The nice thing about Vizcaya is that you can pretty much spend a whole afternoon there. We went through the mansion and some of the garden and them went to their cafe and had lunch and finished seeing the gardens. This took us a little over 4 hours. It was wonderful.,The view of the water is incredible as well. I can only imagine what it looked like when Mr. Deering owned Vizcaya. ,The one thing I will note is that Vizcaya is a popular photo spot. During our visited we saw one        Quinceanera and about 5-6 couples getting their photos taken in the gardens. ,Also, I would try to get there before 12:30 because that seems to be the time it is the most populated with visitors. By 2:30 though, it quiets down again. ,I recommend this to everyone visiting the area. I definitely plan on returning and look forward to my next visit."
"We just had our wedding here. Spend the money to rent this place out, Or, come during a time where there are not so many people. It was absolutely gorgeous. There is not one single area where it would be a bad picture area. The staff there were great on the day before. They helped us thru our paperwork, the lady processing our forms was very informative. Gave us envelopes for everything. Smiled, greeted us, just the works. This is why I love my home town."
"This and the Lincoln Memorial are my go to when I'm in DC. If it's not busy, it's a very serene and peaceful place. Good place to take a book and kick back, or just sit and reflect while taking in the surroundings. One of the must's when in our nation's Capitol."
"This is a stunning library.  The magnificent yet understated art deco exterior architecture is  classy and timeless.  Unlike the quirky and ill-conceived architecture of the egg-shaped library in my home town of San Diego, the L.A. Central Library is perfectly suited to its surroundings.   And yet, the classic exterior does not prepare you for the pleasantly modern and efficient multi-level interior design.  ,At the information desk, a very helpful library employee clued us into two ongoing exhibits, ""Made In L.A."", and ""Bunker Hill"".  The L.A. exhibit was a colorful multi-media presentation, with subjects ranging from Marilyn Monroe to Bob's Big Boy to Lockheed Aircraft.  Now that's diversity !  The Bunker Hill exhibit, a history of a nearby section of L.A. which as been alternatively built up, and torn down over the decades is a bittersweet history of L.A.-style progress.  Ultimately, Bunker Hill was shorn of its traditional gorgeous classic homes and even shaved off to lower it.  One of its current occupants is now the famous Disney Concert Hall.,An amenity of this library is the very nicely staffed and equipped cafe.  Several chain food purveyors have small stores there, and it seems like a very popular place to eat and relax.  There is also a very lush outdoor garden area that is well-populated with trees, shrubbery and yes, park benches.  Shade is a bit limited when the sun is high, but it is beautiful out there.  The library gift store is incredibly well-organized and well-stocked with interesting items ranging from used books to T-shirts. jewelry, and more.,As with most, if not all public libraries, there is a certain number of homeless and transient people lurking within.  However, that issue seemed to be controlled well by library security personnel.,We did not have the time to fully explore this priceless asset, but the areas we visited within the library were excellent experiences.  Libraries can't get any better than this one."
"It's free.   I realize it costs money to travel here and you either take public transportation to get here or pay for parking, but think about how much there is to see and do here.,If you want the full tour and a set time, go to the nearby Center to get your pass.   Or, if you want the ""express"" 12 minute tour, go about 4:45 on a weekend afternoon to stand in line.  They bring in 85 people at a time for a tour of the main floor, where you get plenty of information and context and are in ""the"" room where decisions were made and the document was signed.,It's quite a perspective to view the building from the front or rear with all of the modern city around it and think of all that happened here so many years ago."
"The price for a ticket to the observation deck was $22. ,You can buy tickets at a kiosk or at the ticketing counter towards the entrance. ,There is a security person to check your purse.,They take your tickets to take a free picture that you can check out at the top of the observation deck & also buy in the gift shop.,They then scan your ticket & you wait in line to get onto the elevator.,There is an elevator person on the way up that gives you little snippets of information about the Space Needle and it's history & he answers any questions you may have.,The SkyCity restaurant isn't the best but you pretty much pay for the 360 view of the city, like a legit 360 view (the restaurant rotates slowly) FYI; don't leave anything on the ledge as it will not move with you. Some people leave cute little notes here & there for other people to see, it's cute.,Dining at the restaurant will give you free admission to the observation deck.,I have been up to the observation deck multiple times. It has changed - greatly! ,Outside, they have free binoculars and they have this place where you scan your ticket & it takes a picture of you with the view of the city. And you can email that picture to yourself, pretty cool if you ask me. It gives you a picture that would put a selfie-stick to shame.,Inside they have multiple modules that you can play around with. All based around Seattle & the Space Needle - so I was in heaven :),There is a new module that is a huge touch-screen TV. People can enter where they are from & it records it on a map. It is sooooo cool! & when you post something on social media - it records it. But finding it after you post it, that's a different story. An awesome interactive area where they utilize social media.,The gift shop located on the bottom of the Space Needle has so much to offer, you will find the perfect souvenir - no matter who you are!,All in all, the Space Needle is amazing - no matter how many times I go."
I don't have any complaints. There's never a wait and the reps I get are always nice. The only reason I don't give it 5* is because I HATE having to pay for emissions and tags during the month of my birthday!
"This is how government offices should be run. Friendly front desk, friendly security guards, friendly staff members. I'm guessing everyone who's rated this place has had a bad experience at one government office or another (ahem DMV ahem), and with such low expectations inflation of stars is expected. ,This place, however, is great, I walked in around (late) lunch time and waited 20 minutes exactly. The whole process to apply for a replacement card lasted all in all a grand total of 5 min. Even though that's quick I didn't feel rushed at all. She even took the time to have me double check the information she entered into the system TWICE. ,Service here was definitely appreciated."
"Hart Plaza is a beautiful part of Detroit.  It is a huge park by the water and hosts several of Detroit's festivals.  It has ampitheaters and an ice skating rink as well.  Recently, they added a cruise ship dock.,I love being by the water, so I love this area.  You can see across to Canada from here, and you have a great view of the bridge.  There is always an event that's going on or around the corner.,In Hart Plaza, you will also see a beautiful fountain, the monolith, and other landmarks and pieces of sculptural art.  This is a great place to learn about and bring people if they want to tour detroit.  Althought it is slightly touristy, it is definitely an important part of Detroit."
"Very cool! Gorgeous gardens! Beautiful house! Worth the trip!  We saw a manatee in the water near the ""ship"" looking statue.  What a treat!"
"I can't imagine why everyone doesn't just tie the knot here! It's gorgeous and even though there are thousands of tourists and visitors on a daily basis, try and stick around til about 4-430 so you can have the entire rotunda and stairs to yourselves.  After all the anxiety waiting and the treacherous ceremony waiting.....it pays to have a moment to yourselves of course with your Wedding Photographer ..... capture and freeze that moment forever.,Happy 100th Birthday City Hall, you have made many many many people very happy and will continue to do so for many years and generations to come!"
"Guilty: I double majored in Economics and History...but upon arrival at this monument, I realized I had no idea, off the top of my head, as to what made Thomas Jefferson famous...I had to do some Googling afterwards...apparently after returning from France, he introduced America to Mac & Cheese! I LOVE MAC & CHEESE!!!!! ,For such a large building, the statue is actually quite small in comparison. Seems like they should have built a smaller building, or a much much much bigger statue for the great man who brought us Mac & Cheese!,Murrica!"
"This is quite the library. Exceptional clean for how big it is and the amount of traffic it gets. All books are neatly categorized and easy to find. Artwork and exhibits pepper the corridors and there's even a Getty room full of interactive exhibits. And don't forget to look up - even the ceilings are adorned with murals and installation pieces. ,It's a huge building, yet cozy as various areas are split off into their own little rooms. There's even a cafe and gift shop. I could probably hang out here all day."
"VISIT THIS NATIONAL LANDMARK (and UNESCO World Heritage Site) for FREE !,You will need an appointment ticket - available on line for a $1.50 per ticket service fee, or FREE in person at the Visitor's Center.  To be guaranteed the time and date of your choice, spend the $1.50 (or check availability on line).  During peak summer periods it is advisable to get tickets on-line.  If you are trying to walk-on and things are crazy busy, ask to be on the ""stand by"" list to take the appointment of no-shows.,The visitors center provides restrooms.  Go potty here, as there are NO BATHROOMS ON THE INDEPENDENCE HALL GROUNDS and it's a 10 minute walk away, across two streets + passing through security to get onto the grounds.  MAKE THE KIDS (and Grandma) GO POTTY HERE, otherwise you have a 20+ minute round trip !,The Visitor's Center provides a historical background of the Colonies & Revolutionary War.  Perfect for families with children and foreigners who need a little background.,Get to the Visitor's Center 2 hours earlier than your appointment, so that you can tour the Visitor's Center and the Liberty Bell (across the street between the Independence Hall Visitors Center and Independence Hall) before proceeding to the Independence Hall grounds.,You will have your packages and backpacks checked at the Independence Hall grounds and the Liberty bell Visitors Center.  No firearms, knives, weapons, spray paint, open drinks, chewing gum or cigarettes are allowed. Unopened bottled drinks are okay, but you cannot open them on the grounds.,A 15 minute verbal history lecture is followed by a brief tour of the building.  Most people leave without touring the adjacent Congressional Hall.  Those tours are every 20-30 minutes.  You need to get onto the grounds to do this tour.  This makes the visit complete.,Be wary of the pricing scam at ""The Autopark"" at the Independence Hall Visitors Center (,).  They charge by the hour, not the $9 flat rate as posted on the LARGE ENTRANCE SIGNS (fine print states that the $9 rate is a special off-hours rate - when all of the historical attractions are closed).,Totally worth the visit."
"When we were in Seattle the Space Needle was a must see. With valet parking and the cost of the ticket to the observation deck, we figured why not just go to the top, eat, and enjoy the rotating 360 view? We made reservations for brunch at Sky City and our ticket to the top and valet were comp'd.. Not a bad deal. ,The glass elevator ride is a lot of fun and offers a beautiful view of the city as you travel up 520 feet to the observation deck. There are a few interactive stations up top to play around with including one that allows you to go back to to any day (not sure how many years it went back) and see what the view looked like that day. Pretty cool. There are some free binoculars for spying about, a gift shop (also one downstairs) and a snack stand. It was easy to spend 45 minutes to an hour enjoying the 360 views, especially on a clear day. ,You can see the city, the puget sound, Mt. Rainier and more. While the 360 degree view was amazing from the restaurant, the  observation deck was still definitely worth seeing."
"Recently moved here from California and tried to get my car tagged here and they said it was going to be 1400 dollars to get a tag. My car is a 2012 with 65 thousand miles on it and they said its based on the value of the car. Well I bought the car for 15,000 used a year ago and they are saying the value is almost 21,000 dollars. I seriously don't think the car dealership would have given me a 8,000 dollar discount for being a nice guy. So basically you have to pay 6.75 percent of the 21,000 dollar vehicle. I went to blue book and it said that its only worth 11 and the dealership offered to buy it from me for 9500. What a rip off to live in the state of Georgia.!!!!!"
"For an official place, that usually is unpleasant to visit, this place is relatively nice. The staff is friendly, and try to help, and you can tell that they understand that most people here would prefer not to be here, so they kind of making it easier.,First, getting here early, like 7-7:30 can make a difference between leaving within an hour, and waiting 2-3 hours when arriving later. The line start before they even open.,Second, the place is clean and fresh for SS office. So I must say that they do a great job. Well-oiled machine, other need to learn!"
"i had a bit of a moment on the first day of the demf this year. ,standing on the intersection of woodward and jefferson, seeing the statue of joe louis' fist, the spirit of detroit, the gear, the hart plaza sign and hearing one of detroit's many gifts to the world made me get very emotional. you see, yelp, my first time to detroit was in 2003. i wasn't over a girlfriend that had left me, i hated my living situation, school wasn't going well, i didn't have much of a job to speak of, and the only thing that could be construed as a positive was my car. it looked like a piece of shit, but that mitsubishi was a trooper to the very end. i drove that very car from murfreesboro, tennessee to indianapolis, indiana. met up with a friend at the time and took off to detroit. i had heard a few mixes and tunes that i liked, but that weekend i forgot about everything in the world and fell in love with techno and with detroit. that weekend in 03 was FAR and away the best weekend of my life and detroit and hart plaza were directly responsible for it. ,so yes, now you see why i got a touch mushy nine days ago waiting to cross the street. this is such a great piece of public land that many cities just don't have the luxury of having, detroit. it's almost as though this venue was made for the demf. so manageable, and every stage is so isolated from the others. and this year was ultra loud, detroit. i'm sure windsor complained a lot this year... but you heard no bleeding from stage to stage. the fountain attracted revelers like a uv light attracts mosquitos, but rather than burning up the party-goes they got soaked. i'm sure each of them laughed every time they got splashed on, and i'm sure that memory will stick with them until it's all over.,there were a few times i walked away from a stage and walked out to the main... erm... hallway(?) that led to the fountain and had a look to take it all in and smile.,defend detroit.,eric b"
"I love architecture, so coming to this majestic place was a special treat. I did not even know it was open to the public until a friend mentioned it.  They call it the people's palace, and when you see it inside and out, you'll see why."
"One of the prettiest city halls in the nation.  It's great to marvel at during the day and even at night when it's lit up.  It is open to the public only during the week so if you're planning on visiting, don't try on the weekends.  It's worth the visit because it's right across from the Civic Center Plaza, Asian Art Museum and the public library."
"Yo...the walk to this memorial was bananas.,Why it gotta be so far from The Washington/Lincoln Memorial?,Whatevz, it was still such an iconic spot.,Beautiful trees all around it, and the walk around the basin was nice and relaxing.,Tommy J, they really hooked you up with this ginourmous building/tribute, brah."
"Humongous Central Library!  I have never been throughout the library yet. Probably the biggest and best in Los Angeles. 8 stories of  books is incredible.,I have been here for many events, meetings, seminars, internet access, simple readings and checking out books. So much to see and read here. They have a cool little gift store and cafe inside the library.,Parking is only $1.00 all day on Saturday and Sunday or 1st hour on weekdays. Otherwise parking might be pricey. Across from Westin Bonaventure and City National Bank.,As many patrons have stated, there is a few areas with foul odors that can be very undesirable, but a well maintained facility as a whole."
"I'm going to do what Garland told me to do, because he has my family hostage in New Jersey, which is bad on so many levels. I'm just kidding, I love New Jersey.,He told me to make my review #1776 something do to with July 4th, and so here it is.,Independence Hall is an understated little tourist hot spot in the middle of Philadelphia, which is famous for the reasons you probably already know.,What I love about this site is that you can walk right up to everything, you can drive right past everything and right through everything, and whether you want to do a whirlwind 10 minute sightseeing breeze, or a drawn-out 3-hour everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-epic, it will cater to you. There's a lot to see around this site too, as well as the Hall, such as the Liberty Bell and such. ,You can stand in the room where the Declaration of Independence was signed. Then you can go to the bathroom with your hot significant other (or a stranger) and do very naughty illegal things.,Anything is possibly at Independence Hall. I can even take liberties and ""give indepdendence"" to your own hall, if you want me to. Just say the word."
"Hard to not love this gem of a city icon! I can count on one hand the number of world's fair remnants that I can also purchase a replica of as a paper weight.,Some have mentioned the steep entry fee - whilst working at a local hotel in a past life, we'd recommend people go for lunch and get the observation deck with it. May end up costing $10-15 than just the deck and much more delicious!,If you make it on a nice day it's breath taking and unforgettable!"
"I loathe government offices. My experience has been that no matter how much paper work you have (birth certificates, driver's licenses, passports, titles, and so on) the gov. worker is going to type something in to that computer, look at the screen with squinted eyes, grunt, and say, ,""Did you bring a notarized copy of the results of your last gynecological exam and a sample of your stool?"" ,So today I needed to get new tags and the title transferred for one car and just the title transferred for another car. I'm thinking that this is not going to go well. It's going to be too much. I'm still shocked. I only waited about 10 minutes before I was seated before a man who processed my requests quickly and without any problems. I could not believe it. I was like in and out. Unbelievable. This has inspired a small shift in my paradigm as it relates to dealing with the gov. and his workers. This shift is incredibly small though. Still, I was very please with my business interaction at the tag office today. ,Okay but there was that awkward moment when the worker looked at my sample and asked, ""What's that?"" Crickets.,One important thing to note:  They do not accept plastic at all.  You need your checkbook or cash!!!!!"
"I grew up going to Hart Plaza every summer. There is ALWAYS a festival going on downtown, and Hart Plaza is where it is at. Tons of people outside + vendors + sunny weather = a great time always. Country, International Jazz, African American and Gospel are just a few of the festivals that take place during the summer, weekends at a time. They have about three stages and even an underground area in case it rains. I haven't been this year yet, but I have heard that they are starting to charge now (It used to be free)...so bring your pocketbooks.,Parking is a HASSLE. So definitely have patience and don't mind walking. There are a few lots across the street. Do not park on random streets because the towing companies get VERY happy around this time."
"Didn't go inside, just got some Christmas color photos of the outside.  Nice looking city hall."
"Legends never die, they live forever. The late Thomas Jefferson is a legendary man. He was the archetypal Renaissance Man. In his lifetime; he was an architect, musician, political philosopher, book collector, horticulturist, inventor, one of the drafters of the Declaration of Independence, and third President of the United States of America from 1801 to 1809. The Thomas Jefferson legacy lives in the Jefferson Memorial. ,   The Jefferson Memorial is on 2.5 acres along the Southeast shoreline of the Tidal Basin. The designers purposely planned the Jefferson Memorial to be exactly south of the White House and Washington Monument. As a matter of fact the 19 foot high bronze  statue of Thomas Jefferson is looking directly at the White House. With that said, the views of the White House, Washington Monument, Tidal Basin, and Washington D.C. from the Jefferson Memorial are second to none. It just takes some effort climbing up all the marble steps to reach the rotunda. One of my dearest moments in Washington D.C. was watching the sundown over the Tidal Basin from the rotunda.,   Thomas Jefferson was a man who had a way with words. His famous quotes are displayed on the four panels of the interior walls. They tell a story of a legendary man who strongly believed in democracy, freedom, and education. Reading his words were inspirational. Just as touching as Thomas Jefferson's words is the memorial dedicated to him.,  The Jefferson Memorial is down the shoreline from the FDR Memorial. The two men's bonding goes beyond the shoreline connecting their memorials. FDR respected Thomas Jefferson and paid his respect with the idea of the Jefferson Memorial. J.R. Pope designed it in 1936 with Neo-classical architecture. The circular dome is influenced by the Pantheon in Rome. Fast forward a few years to 1943, and FDR paid the ultimate compliment to Thomas Jefferson with the opening of the Jefferson Memorial. ,   It was on our first full day in Washington D.C., where I visited the Jefferson Memorial and back in 1984 on a school field trip. Anyways the Jefferson Memorial was  the last landmark we saw on a tour of the memorials and monuments on the West National Mall and Tidal Basin shoreline. The walk from the FDR Memorial to the Jefferson Memorial added to the experience. The Jefferson Memorial is a mesmerizing site reflecting on the Tidal Basin. With each step forward on the treeline walking path on the shore the Jefferson Memorial became closer and more spectacular. We'd take in scenes of paddle boats and geese enjoying life in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson. In my opinion, if you have a few days in Washington D.C., I highly recommend a walk along the Tidal Basin to the Jefferson Memorial instead of being dropped off there. Fortunately we caught the Jefferson Memorial when the sun was transitioning to night over the Tidal Basin and beyond (I think Thomas Jefferson would like photography). This was the ultimate conclusion to a day touring the sights of Washington D.C.,   Legendary people never die. Thomas Jefferson lives on in the Jefferson Memorial."
"One word; LOVE!,Support your local public library."
"A Special Visit and Experience.,To be in the room where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence is a moment you'll not soon forget. The visit is brief - For 30 minutes or so you'll get a condensed history of the hall from a knowledgeable guide. The idea here is to visually take it all in. The tight chairs and desks - tightness of the room in general. The original colors of the room are retained here,Tour is free - Winter visits result in smaller lines - faster entry and tickets may not be needed. ,Just go..."
"I'm seriously SO HAPPY that it was blue skies and no rain on the day my boyfriend and I decided to visit the Space Needle.,For $38 each, my boyfriend and I got the Space Needle - Chihuly Garden and Glass combo ticket from Expedia. Redeem it at the will call window. No need to wait in the long line!,PROTIP: Visit right before sunset so that you can get the day time view, the sunset view, and even the night time view!,So many great photo ops! You can scan your ticket and the camera installed up top will take a photo for you. Then you can head on inside to download the photo. I absolutely love beautiful views and the Space Needle provided just that."
"Slow service, error quoting title transfer fees, unacceptable waiting time to speak to a representative on the phone. It could not get any worse. So glad I moved away from ATL and won't have to deal with them in the future."
"I definitely did not abide by the 30 day rule once I moved to Atlanta,  only for the simple fact I was absolutely dreading having to deal with GA DDS and GA MVD.  However 2.5 months,  1 car accident and 1 expired Florida tag later I decided it was time to bite the bullet.   For 2 reasons.  1) I cannot ""stretch"" the truth too well when under pressure by law enforcement.  2) I do not trust the USPS at all to forward a new set of Florida tags using my current forwarding.   ,I must say besides for the absolute mountain of paperwork I was required to produce I spent a combined 45 minutes getting my GA DL and GA Tag on two separate days in two separate offices.  I made sure to call the MVD before I went down as their website showing what is required for tag transfer from another state reads like a legal document.  ,I walked in the door at the Pryor St. SW government building on the nose at 8:00AM and was at work (10 minutes away) sitting at my desk by 8:35AM with a shiny new GA license plate.   Security checkpoint coming in was quick and the guards could see I was lost so they offered assistance.   The lady I worked with was quick,  very friendly and took my $312 with a smile.,Couple hints if you are a newcomer to Georgia.  ,#1)  For your DL go to the doublewide trailer by Turner Field and get there about 10-20 minutes before opening on a weekday.  20 minutes from check in to exit with my temp DL.  Don't even bother with the appointments.   My other half did this at one of the Marietta locations and still waited around for ~2.5 hours.  ,#2)  Call the department (DDS or MVD) customer service line before to verify what you will need.,#3)  Downtown Pryor St. tag office was actually quite nice and street parking was plentiful.  Just remember Pryor St. does not have street parking 7-9AM and the side streets have parking enforcement starting at 7:00AM,   I  wrongly assumed it was later but luckily did not get knicked by ParkAtlanta.   ,#4)  Learn to love Atlanta but hate the State of Georgia,  the second you start working and living in this state they shove their vacuum nozzle straight into your wallet or purse and grab as much as they possibly can.   Taxachusetts has nothing on this place."
"Plaza area is great, stay at the hotels in the Renaissance Center and you'll be in a good area,  but don't leave that area or you'll be very disappointed.  I made the mistake of checking out some of the nightlife and found that there isn't much unless you like taking chances with your life."
"Definitely the most breathtaking memorial in my opinion. From the ginormous statue to the script on the walls, it's truly a sight to see. ,Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"I had the pleasure of visiting the Jefferson Memorial when I went to DC for the Cherry Blossom festival. The Thomas Jefferson Memorial is a presidential memorial in Washington, D.C., dedicated to Thomas Jefferson,he was a drafter and writer of the Declaration of Independence. ,I went there after visiting the National and Lincoln monument and it was the time of sunset. To be honest I was not interested in visiting this place as it was a bit far from the two above mentioned monuments but I decided to give it a go and trust me it was totally worth it. The memorial was not as big as the Lincoln memorial but the night time view that I got was amazing. I took the metro to go to DC as my friends had warned me about the parking situation in DC, it especially gets busy during the festival.,After walking for approximately 10 minutes from the National memorial the sight of the white marble gorgeous memorial building blew me away. The statue of Jefferson was the white tall sitting statue inside the circular room; the walls have certain scriptures taken from the Declaration of Independence, where Jefferson played an important role. The place have restrooms downstairs with a display of Jefferson's life and contribution to the formation of the country. The place was not crowded like the other memorials around it, so it was kind of an escape for me from the crowded hectic day; as I had the chance to enjoy the cool breeze that blew through me while I was sitting in the calm and quiet environment.,If you come to DC or make plans to visit the Lincoln and National monuments make sure to add this monument to your plan."
"Free tour, you'll learn something, the folks who run it seem to be enthusiastic about it, and the stuff is well-presented. Great way to spend a half hour or so when you're in Philly."
"What's this? A house? A Tree? An U.F.O.?!,No! ,It's the Space Needle! (So UFO was pretty close),A must-see and incredible landmark of this great city, what would the skyline of Seattle be without it? ,And it gets even more exiting when you make it to the top to enjoy a great view over Queen Anne Hill, the Puget Sound, Seattle Downtown, Capitol Hill and Lake Union. On good days you can see the skyline of Bellevue on the other side of lake Washington and on even better days you can see the olympics and the cascades! ,I've just got an annual pass (it's much cheaper that way if you visit more often and you don't have to wait in every line) and so I can enjoy the view no matter what weather is ruling the day."
Beautiful views of the capital and the cherry blossoms! What a fantastic monument!
"What a gorgeous monument. The Thomas Jefferson Memorial is a bit off the beaten path and not in the general vicinity of the other monuments as you'd assume. For some reason or another, the statue of TJ is eerily sumptuous to me, especially at night when viewing him from afar as he basks in the glow of a many backlight. Gives me chills."
"This memorial is dramatic in its own right. Its not as massive as Lincoln, or as ornate at WWII, but it still is a must visit when visiting DC.,Our 3rd President stands tall in the middle of the rotunda, with quotes surrounding him.  We came on a wintery day, so the inside was a bit dim and the surrounding area quite stark.  I'm sure when the cherry blossoms are out, the Memorial is qute beautiful and well lit.,On the Hop on/ Hop off bus, they take you on the back side.  Be sure to Hop OFF so you can see the front."
So beautiful.  Took my breath away.
"absolutely gorgeous a must go, hours of entertainment and a very historic, artistic, and great photo location. I will be back because my wife loves taking modeling photos and this place is awesome you always see a professional group doing wedding photos and other stuff there and we will do the same."
We should have taken the guided tour - it was raining and would have loved to walk some of the trails.  The gardens are beautiful!
"For original review with many pictures, please see ,Vizcaya is a really neat place, even when you consider that it was recently built, so the patina of history surrounding it is fake. Nonetheless, it has a gardens and an amazing house with all sorts of interesting architecture.,The grounds are extensive, and just the sort of perfect thing for the well-heeled Miami wedding. We saw not one, not two, but three separate wedding parties there. Out of curiosity, I called to see how much it cost to rent the place; renting for one night for up to 100 guests was $12k for a weekend or $7k for a weekday.,Given the extensive and amazing grounds, of course a good deal of our time was finding a spot where I'd be happy with the lighting. I hate pictures with flash! Given what a snob I am about the right natural lighting, we would walk all over until I finally decided that some spot was a good spot.,Vacaya is serene, a great place to walk around with that special someone with hand holding."
"I hardly leave any reviews but I do have to give this office a 5 star.  Why? I went to the social security office in Jamaica Center, the line was 3 hours long before entering the building.  Why should I waste my precious time?  So I looked for other SSA office and took my chance going there after work, with only half hour window before they close on Friday.  And I went in, took my number and left within 15 minutes, I left at 4:05 pm (I think).  But the whole process was totally a smooth experience.  I totally recommend going to this office."
Just a great spot in Miami. The volunteers are so well educated on the grounds and history they are just amazing!
"Walking into this beautiful historic landmark was stunning. This is a hidden gorgeous gem in Miami. You instantly feel like you are somewhere else. Want to escape the hustle and bustle on a relaxing day, come here. Refreshing, beautiful gardens, sculptures and statues,  breathtaking views of the bay. So much to see.,I agree this is such a romantic place. As you stroll through the gardens and fountains you find yourself at peace and harmony. I would enjoy coming here with a book while sitting on a bench as it is such a relaxing atmosphere. To visit with out of town guest or with your significant other, a great time will be had. Reminiscing about your love while sitting or strolling through the oh so many acres of pure lushness beauty.,To see at night was so memorable. I am looking so forward to visiting again and again during the day, maybe even catch a tour. Price is no object for such beauty and elegance. This to me is a little piece of heaven and serenity. Can not wait to visit real soon as I think this might be one of my favorite places to visit in Miami."
"Beautiful Miami landmark, worth checking out.  If you go, try to pick a day when it's not so hot; as you'll be doing a lot of walking and you'll want to explore the estate's gardens.,If you take the tour, try to get the older southern looking gentleman-dudeman.  He's the best guide there.,Vizcaya hosts a lot of big soiree's, so if you ever get a chance to go; I suggest you check out a groovy shin-dig there.,Rumor has it the owner was gay, and I'm inclined to believe it.  Originally he just wanted a simple estate with a big porch overlooking the water.  Then he met the person who would eventually design the place.  So here's what probably happened.  Deering(the owner) meets this ""fab designer"" and once the designer realizes how much money Deering has, he goes way overboard in creating this over the top place.  ,""Oh honey, we need to go to Italy and buy this, and then you'll take me to Paris and we'll be these classic period what-not's.  And THENNN.... we'll buy Mozart's baby piano thingy, etc.etc."" You get the picture.  ,I think this story makes sense, because Deering never married and he had a lifelong 'friendship' with the designer who talked him into creating this opulent masterpiece with his money when all he wanted was a quiet warm home to go to in the winter time to escape the cold northern winter climate.,You go and draw your own conclusions.  I just think it's funny that the Vizcaya people avoid the obvious likelihood.  I mean come on, we're in the new millennium.   If the guy was gay, that's what he was.  Get over it.  Don't try to sweep it under the rug like an out of touch, ashamed grandparent."
"The mansion was beautiful and I was very much impressed with the architecture, the painting, stone sculptures inside and outside the mansion and the untouched and well preserved rooms. The view from the dock is breathtaking. I loved sitting on those staircase by the water and enjoying the sun.,The food in the cafe was good and fairly priced. ,However, I felt the property wasn't well maintained, I saw weeds on the staircases and around the building. Some parts of the garden was a big dissapointment. None of the water fountains were working. From the website pictures, I had big expectation and I felt like I didn't get the same experience when I physically visited.,It was ok to visit one time, not going back again."
"Beautiful place to visit with family and take pictures outside. Bring your student id and entry drops to 10 dollars, def worth it."
"I went to an AIDS event called the White Party several years ago here with some friends ,who at the time, owned a club called LEVEL (which is now Mansion). This place took my breath away.  We came in on a friend's yacht and and docked.  They had beautiful men half naked posing on columns with angel wings, stations of food in the gardens and some really hot music playing.  I did not want the night to ever end.  Have not seen Vizcaya since it was damaged by hurricane Wilma and Katrina(,).  Breaks my heart...."
"A most see here in Miami. You can't take pictures inside the house.,The house is big and you can bring kids if you can control them. Touching anything is forbidden and there's a reason for that. The whole house is a work of art covering different styles and ages.,The entry pass is cheap. 18 dlls per Adult. There's discount for seniors and children. You can buy a printed guide or an audio guide (they lend you headphones and a player).,A beautiful place to visit indeed!"
"I have to agree with the other Yelpers. Suprisingly simple and pleasant for a government office. Very happy with my experience here.,Came here to change the name on my SS card and request a new one. I got in at about 8:30am - didn't want to chance it at a later time. Took a number and was called up in less than 5 minutes. The lady was very pleasant. I was out of there in less than 10-15 minutes. There is a bathroom in the office as well, clean and spacious. ,Not sure if it gets busier during a later time - possibly. If you can, go earlier to not risk it. If you have the option of coming to this office - go!"
"This place is very enjoyable, especially if you like history. The property is scenic and there is a lot to look at.  I can't remember if there was a tour or not."
"I love this place! The garden is gorgeous and breath taking. Me and a group of 7 girls went on a very hot sunny day and was soaked and sticky afterwards but it is worth the sweat. It is a scenic place to explore, take pictures and appreciate the architecture and landscaping."
Very beautiful. Felt like I was in Italy. Loved it.
It's a live version of the show Cribs except at an old mansion built and owned by a dead rich person.
"Before planning our short stay in Miami I didn't know much about it. I used a travel guide and it highly recommended Vizcaya. I double checked on Trip Advisor and it had excellent reviews there as well. Decided to make a stop here a priority while we were there. That was a good decision.,The grounds at Vizcaya are beautiful. The gardens are lovely, the European design is well planned out, and is the epitome of opulent. Apparently even back in the day, the owner would have his guests arrived on Venetian gondolas. There is even a large ""pavilion"" that looks like a boat that guests were boated out to. It is crazy how much planning and money must have gone into the design of the grounds. ,The interior is not much different. It is also the epitome of opulent. Often the owner would find something that he liked in Europe and would have it shipped over and put in his home. This includes ceilings, windows, doors, fountains, and fireplaces. Dude could pretty much buy anything that he wanted.,It is pretty neat seeing how the wealthy lived and how ridiculous (yet gorgeous) the whole thing can be. If you like art this is definitely a must do for you. If you like landscaping this is also a place for you. A visit here is not cheap but not ridiculously priced. I think we spent about $20 each and were there for about 3 hours. I HIGHLY recommend the audio tour. It is very interesting. A lot of things aren't well labeled so being able to hear explanations made the whole thing more enjoyable. You need to pay an addition $5 for the audio tour but I think it is pretty much a requirement for full appreciation of Vizcaya."
"Its nice, but was a bit bellow my expectations honestly. Not stroller friendly. Gardens are pretty and the water view is very beautiful."
"Visiting Vizcaya historic landmark during the summer is always an adventure, specially with the rainy hurricane season. Regardless, you're always in for a treat exploring the grounds influenced by European gardens and architecture. Since Florida is not really known for preserving historical sites, I'm really pleased that the property has remained operating and the staff works on preventive preservation of the remaining items at this estate. ,Fun fact:Deering was a prominent aristocrat he enjoyed his gin and smokes. ,Also if you're a student bring your ID you will receive a discount. They have discounts for senior citizens as well.,Apparently this location is also popular for photographers to do shootings for sweet sixteens and weddings. You will occasionally see the girls in big poofy dresses posing. ,Visit this location you will enjoy the rich culture and ambience."
"NO... I didn't make a mistake.,I ""LITERALLY"" give this Government Office a 5 STAR!!!,Came in at 11 AM, right one block away from Fulton Street Station.,3rd floor, 2 guards asked me what I came for and told me to fill out some information thru the touch screen computer (which it has 5 different languages available). and a Ticket number will be printed out.  ,Sat down and waited 2 minutes.... Later I hear an announcement for my number and which booth number to go to. (There's about 40 of them).,Friendly staff, asked for my documents and my SS Card and literally finished it in 5 minutes!.,VOILA!.  I wish other offices are like this!.,So yeah.... I would 100 percent RECOMMEND this location.  Efficient, clean, and FAST!."
"The Viscaya museum was a tiny part of my personal adventure for the day since my friend had to be at a conference. Being a tripadvisor junkie I was finding my spot for the day and the users all voted the Vizcaya gardens to be the #1 attraction in Miami so i  knew I had to check it out.,I was sure in for a treat. It was accessible by the metrorail for tourists like me ( approx 10 minute walk) and i just loved sitting by the garden with my ipod taking in all the sunshine and the fresh air. This place actually reminded me of the ancient agora I visited in Athens. It truly felt like Europe. The house is like a treasure hunt as each and every room was decorated in a different theme. At times 'i felt like I was in a haunted house. I really couldn't imagine  someone actually living here as is looks to extravagant to be true.,Overall:  Nice Escape from the Miami beach scene ,Note: Bring your student id and you can get in for 5 dollars ( adults admission: 10 dollars)"
"We opted for the self guided audio tour and quickly toured the house while the guided tour slowly made their way from room to room. We spent most of our time at Vizcaya taking in the gorgeous gardens, acres and acres of gardens. The gazebo to the south east part of the house overlooking Biscayne Bay was an especially whimsical little spot for us. We enjoyed the cafe which had better than average food for a museum and a nice environment in which to eat it."
"This is the most beautiful and history filled home I have ever seen. It is the Hearst Castle of the East Coast. This mansion has art, sculptures, and tapestries from various locations in Europe. This home is very well preserved. The tour through the home is very informative, the grounds are beautiful. Definitely a place to have a garden wedding or quinceanera at. ,No photos are allowed inside the mansion, but you can take pictures outside. There is a fee, but if you are a student or military- you received a discount. There is a small coffee shop/gift shop, but it is over priced. I wouldn't waste my time in there. ,Expect to spend about 2 hours in the mansion and on the grounds.,Note: For non Spanish speakers, employees speak English."
"The museum is boring. It's like walking through grandmas ancient crib. ,...the garden on the other hand is refreshingly beautiful from that eyesore of a dungeon."
"Gorgeous house and jaw-dropping grounds.,I'm glad I made it to the Vizcaya during my Miami trip back in November because the sights definitely stuck with me."
"still my favorite memorial in DC. ,great place to take pictures of the cherry blossoms as you walk from the national monument/WWII memorial around the tidal basin to the FDR memorial. ,the current construction makes the walk a little more complicated and a little longer so don't hug the basin, stay on the jogging path."
"This place is beautiful, like a slice of Italy in Florida. It's one of my favorite places to go. The food in the cafe is good, too."
"Excellent experience~ The fanciful imagination that went into this artistic creation is clearly visible everywhere; experiencing it is awesome. What I loved about it is that it's not a copy of anything but rather a compilation of all sorts of fanciful bits and pieces of the Renaissance and later. Yes, it's gaudy in places but artful. Outdoor sculptures and decor are filled with rococo, over the top elements, everything from mermaids and mythological creatures to natural history, sea serpents, and seahorses. You could spend hours poring over the indoor art and design, furnishings, murals, and tapestries collected over decades. The Cafe is excellent too; people working there genuinely care that visitors are enjoying themselves. A sweet young woman named Alexandra helped an older lady find her way and even got her a glass of water from the outdoor fountain in the rain."
"I'm not entirely sure how to actually review a memorial... ,I guess I'll start my saying it's absolutely awe-inspiring. The structure, marble, and monument itself is drop-dead gorgeous. You just walk inside and feel tiny, while knowing you're experiencing a critical part of American history and importance. Talk about making you feel proud. ,Then you turn around and realize you have a phenomenal view of the Washington monument, DC and the water. Could you really ask for me? ,Oh, well if you can, here are a few other perks: ,1) It's free,2) It's epic,3) No lines,4) No vendors hanging around trying to poach business with expensive souvenirs (there's one booth at the entrance, that's it),5) It's beautiful,6) Did I mention it's free and well, just important to experience at least twice in your life? Yes, twice--once as a child and at least once as an adult.,I can't wait to come back and re-experience DC in all it's glory as an adult, since this was the only memorial/monument I got to revisit on this trip (since my 7th grade field trip back in the day.)"
"The place looks like a worn down crack house, dirty disgusting, should have been torn down years ago, but there are far too many baseball idiots in this town, I guess. Access is a problem, parking is outlandish, I love how they jack up the local parking rates $15 - $20 on game nights..people crowding the streets of Kenmore square who are too stupid to comprehend a ""Don't Walk"" traffic signal..there should be a free for all day where motorists have free reign ala Grand Theft Auto..would be fun and help thin the herd...Note: This is what I LOVE about California..if you cross the street druing a ""Don't Walk"" signal and a cop sees you: $100 fine..if they did this in Boston, the budget would be balanced overnight, and they could definitively repeal all the taxes we pay!!!,drunk morons shouting and making noise. Hopefully someday they will wise up and rip the place down and put in another 'Best Buy'..which would be far more practical!..what a toilet."
"This was a very cool memorial but tough to get to.  I rented a car to drive around in D.C.  I was able to get to every monument by car, but this was the hardest to get to. I'm guessing it might have been for security purposes or to confuse tourist drivers like myself to accidentally end up on the other side of the freeway where the Pentagon is located.  Or maybe I was just tired from a long day of driving several states.  I recommend checking this place out if you're ever in town but just take the metro.  Its easier to walk around."
"For those who of you who have a soft spot for botanical gardens and historical art, you'll love the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens!,My boyfriend and I came here directly after our Carnival cruise from Cozumel.  Knowing that we had little time before our flight, we came here on a whim and spent a good 2-3 hours here exploring the estate of John Deering, who was a fine businessman who had a love for art.  It certainly shows from the paintings he's collected to the fine rooms that have their own personalities to the Greek/Roman statues surrounding the gardens outside.  Absolutely breathtaking and worthwhile to visit.,As I walked around the grounds of the estate, I imagined myself as if I were walking in a whole new world that I've never explored right here in Miami or in the U.S.!  I have never been to Europe but the way Cassie G. described the wonders of this place made me feel like I was in Europe for the first time. The estate itself, inside and out, is beautifully made and the different rooms have their own individual looks that there's so much to admire.  You can truly see so much of life's history in all of these rooms.,Parking is free here but there is an entrance fee.  It's cheaper if you have a student ID too!  I was lucky enough to pay the student rate even though I forgot my student ID back home in California.,If I could, I would run around and play along the gardens all day.  Growing up in the Vizcaya estate would be an awesome experience especially for a imaginative, dreamer like myself.,A must if you are ever in Miami!"
"Like reviewers mentioned before, this place is a well-oiled machine. Other government offices can certainly learn from this office. I came here at 8:20am and out the door at 8:37am. So fast!!"
"I LOVE Vizcaya. I love anything with history behind it. Take your time to explore inside and out. The gardens are breath taking soo beautiful. Great place to have a picnic. I really enjoy visiting during christmas time beautiful weather, and gorgeous decorations! please do yourself a favor and visit. Cheaper rates for miami locals."
"This place is pretty magical to me, and reminds me of my childhood, so I guess I'm a bit biased.  I can't help but get a single every time I walk up that ramp and see the field.  I'm a pretty big fan of all the renovations they've done to the park in recent years.  This additions, combined with the Sox success has really lead to a family friendly environment.   Sure it's old as dirt, but that's part of the charm the place has. I loves me some Fenway Park."
"This place is amazing. You should definitely visit this place if you go to Miami. There are beautiful gardens in different levels with a view to the ocean. The museum is very nice too. I could not imagine someone actually lived there. ,We went there around noon time and spend about 2 hours there before going to the airport. Make sure to take photos. It is a must see."
"I liked how the architecture included the outside through the use of loggias. I loved the tower rooms but my favorite was the breakfast room with its air conditioning and view.  The second level smells like incense.  I'm glad we saw the concrete boat, secret garden, and tearoom before wedding reception set up was complete.  We were here for at least 2.5 hours. ,  In comparison to Hearst Castle there is a sense of decay, especially as the abandoned edges of the gardens look like they can easily be reclaimed by the jungle.   There were two trailer trucks inside the West entrance so I thought there was a fashion shoot at first.  Yesterday there was also a fruit wine tasting in front of the gift shop. We pretended to play Pac-Man in the maze garden. Why can't they move quincenera photography to after visitor hours?"
"How are people giving a monument bad ratings?! It's beautiful and I was awestruck. It does need more cabstands, though. But that's up to the cabbies."
"What a great place.  I have been here many, many times and will keep coming back as much as possible!  One of my all time favorite places!  GO SOX!"
"Tractor Tycoon builds castle!  This is a must-see for any visit to the Miami area.  Great story of the man who created it (James Deering of International Harvester), beautiful, though somewhat enigmatic house, but it's the exterior that steals the show.  As a landscape architect, this may seem expected, but the south side garden with mounds, north side swimming pool and constructed ship out in the bay are remarkable.  I think of this as Miami's Biltmore, Huntington Gardens, or Hearst Castle., though not on such a grand scale."
"Wow!  What can I say?  The staff are all very pleasant, especially in the gift shop and cafe; as well as, the security guards who never miss a beat with a warm smile! ,I first visited Viscaya Gardens six (6) months ago, early May 2013, and again on October 18, 2013 with my 25yr. young son who was visiting from NY, who couldn't stop saying how amazing the place was!  And I agree!!!  It was/is a very breathtaking environment!  As a visitor I was taken aback by the scenery, gardens and landscapes; and I can't forget to mention The Main House!!! The architecture and the Rococo, 18th century style period rooms are wonderful!  As a designer I was intrigued by its history, which was described in the museum's booklet [that can be purchased for $3) a MUST purchase, and READ!  ,What was an added treat (both times I visited the gardens), seeing photographers and their entourage taking pictures of teens/young ladies around the garden, who were wearing elaborate, brightly colored gowns or party dresses; their hair & make-up no doubt, professionally applied... as their family watched their young daughters, nieces, sisters etc., coming of age in what they hoped to be memorial pictures!  ,As you can see I not only love this place, but appreciate it!"
"Ducked in for a quickie tour and to evaluate the place as a set for a special event or upcoming project to do some video production. ,I love Vizcaya and have been here many times over the year for different events and parties like Halloween and Valentine's Day. ,Well, well worth a visit. Formerly the residence of area forefather and community businessman, founder, and all around icon, James Deering, the joint is now owned by Miami-Dade County and is sat on Biscayne Bay in the present day Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida. ,It was also the primary set location for 80's film ""The Whoopie Boys."" The early 20th century Vizcaya estate includes extensive Italian Renaissance gardens; a native woodland landscape; and a historic village outbuildings compound. The landscape and architecture were influenced by Veneto and Tuscan Italian Renaissance models and designed in the Mediterranean Revival architecture style, with Baroque elements. Paul Chalfin was the design director (from Wikipedia).,Open to the public. Wait until it isn't Summer to visit, unless you love heat, humidity, and schvitzing. ,Cabeza OUT!"
"Very nice, very meditative.  I wasn't sure what the difference between a memorial and a monument was.  I'm not exactly sure why some Presidents get statues, and others don't get statues."
"I have a very vivd memory of seeing my mum sitting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial and my fiance taking a photo of her looking out to Tidal Basin. I do wonder if perhaps Jefferson has the greatest Memorial spot. From where he stands he has a perfect view over Tidal Basin to the Washington Monument. It's a beautiful memorial. Find a nice day, and head over to check it out. Take a camera!"
"This place earns one star for still being able to stand up.  This old, rotting park has numerous obstructions to viewing a game.  Come on people, don't give it five stars just because it hosts the Red Sox, who one must admit are perennial losers.  It is ironic that the Washington Redskins played right down the street at BU when they began in Boston, as both teams have ridiculous salaries and never win when it counts.  Anyway, if it isn't enough that the place is a mess, the bathrooms look like a third world country, the fans are rude, and the place is treated like it was the place of Jesus' birth, then you have to deal with the most overpriced tickets in all of baseball.  That is if you can even get a ticket!  What people don't realize is the owners cultivate these stupid stereotypes like the ""Curse of the Bambino,"" and the fact that Fenway is an ""institution"" (more like a mental one) in order to keep the tiniest park in all of sports and drive up prices and profits.  Come on, John Henry is a commodities broker, the man doesn't care if the team wins or loses.  Anyway, just thought I'd give the straight story to out of towners who might be deceived by Red Sox fans into thinking that this is the ""greatest park ever built.""  Trust me, it's not.  One more thing, some jerk will either throw or spill a beer near you, and you will definitely hear Yankees suck chants constantly, even though they have 26 World Championships to the Red Sox, who are around 10.  Hope this review helps."
"A monument to one of my favorite presidents. It's situated away from the National Mall with its own place along the Potomac River. Some might see this as a drawback, but it forces people to make some effort to see the memorial. The structure itself is magnificent. The large statue of Thomas Jefferson in the center of the neoclassical dome with excerpts from his most famous writings etched on the wall. The Jefferson Memorial is at its most beautiful during the cherry blossoms season. It is a fitting monument to one of America's greatest presidents."
"My main takeaways from this museum & garden were:,James Deering and his interior designer poured their heart into designing this home. They would travel around the world to find the perfect rooms to put into their home. Yes that is right, they would build the house around the room & objects that they buy abroad rather than the way normal people buy the house first and then fill it up with things.,I want a house next to the water too. How awesome did his guests have it to be able to row up to his home and enter his beautiful grand entrance. ,Stone homes like this make the house look super amazing.,I need to be a better host and give my guests their own private room with a private spiral staircase so they have privacy and can hear the beautiful sounds of the water from their rooms.,I need a giant dining room like him too.,I also need a music room for entertaining.,My garden needs to be be bigger. But I noticed he did not plant any edible food. Just mangroves and shrubs. ,I want my second dining room and kitchen upstairs as well so the food smells doesn't go through the entire house.,I need a theme in my home too. James Deering's theme was seahorses and ships. ,Get the audio tour. You'll learn all the ins and outs of the place, and it could give you ideas on what you future/dream home could look like too, as well as all the considerations you might have been building your home. ,A good two hours here at least. ,If you have time, stop by for afternoon tea at James Deering's home. It is a lovely outdoor section to have a snack after touring the place."
Very efficient. Got there at 7:15am with only a passport in hand for a card replacement. Was out of there at 7:25am. Got card in the mail a week later.
"Wow, the Vizcaya mansion is beautiful. I am so glad I stopped here as part of my Miami trip. It's a historical house, built by some entrepreneur named John Deering back in 1914-1916. He had traveled the world, namely to Europe and Asia, and wanted to create a ""fusion"" home in Miami where he could wow his guests with his massive art collection and gorgeous architecture. ,FIrst off, admission is $10 each if you have a student ID, a senior ID, or a military ID card. Otherwise, I believe it's $20. There's plentiful parking and most of the grounds are ADA-accessible.,The house is a mixture of Italian villa architecture and Miami tropical architecture, complete with an open-air courtyard in the middle of the mansion. The other rooms of the home - bedrooms, kitchen, bathrooms, etc - are built around the courtyard. It's awesome. For it's day the Vizcaya was actually high tech. It had light switches, an elevator, plenty of private bathrooms, and multiple refrigerators. It's really cool to see these contraptions in their native state.,For me, however, the crowning jewel was the lovely, expansive gardens. They are stunning. Some are styled after English countryside gardens, some are more manicured, like Italian or French gardens. There are fountains, statues, and figurines... it's a great place for photographs.,Be sure to go on a cooler day, because the gardens can get pretty hot and smelly in the humidity and heat of Miami. All in all, a wonderful experience, well worth the time and 2 hours we spent there."
fenway park is a very historical place. i went to my first red sox game when i was visiting Boston. The people behind me kept making me laugh. plus the food was not bad. i enjoyed a good game and good food.     go sox!!!!!!
"Absolutely beautiful place to visit.  I highly recommend doing the audio tour.  You get a lot of additional information about the groundwork, architecture, and small details/gems throughout the property that you may not have noticed otherwise. Lots of rich history is packed in this place, not to mention it's simply beautiful -- the artwork, mansion, garden, and waterfront view.  Highly recommend!"
Beautiful garden and house.  A good sight seeing experience
It was a nice tour and the outside was pretty.  But the tour guide lady seems like she needs a time out.
"Um...Lincoln is way cooler than Jefferson...and the location...terrible!!,But seriously...it does seem a little out of the way but otherwise not too bad."
"I love love going to Fenway. There is something nearly magical about going here. You can feel the history, the lingering emotional impressions  of legions of die-hard fans, and just standing there, you can easily imagine wonderful sepia snapshots of every aspect of being there. Even the fact that you pay $4.50 for Crackerjacks (mostly sans peanuts these days) doesn't deter from the wonderfulness of Fenway. I went for a recent game and had standing only tickets, which I thought would be a bummer, but you know, for $25 we had an awesome standing view near home plate and between first base. ,Worth it though, if you come to Boston and can't get tickets, to pay the exhorbitant scalping fee to experience this amazing amazing place."
"PHONE TO ASK THE HOURS!!!  When we were there the LAST Tour started at 2:30 pm, but the Museum and Gardens stayed open until 5:00 pm, even though the website says:  9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  PHONE THEM BEFORE YOU GO!!!!,This place is impressive, and very interesting for anyone who likes to see lots of old furniture, but compared to the Hearst Castle in California, it is WAY worn down by rain.  Almost every outdoor statue and walkway and some of the walls, etc... have lots of huge holes in them.  It's really sad.  That's because it was mostly made out of soft coral, I guess.  While at the Hearst Castle everything was made out of marble and granite, and nothing is worn out as far as I recall."
"Very beautiful mansion and nature, you can take awesome pictures, they do a lot of weddings photo shoots there, you can walk there for hours and anywhere you go it is just beautiful and takes your mind away somewhere to the 16 century..."
Came to visit my brother in miami and had to go see it... Amazing  architecture and beautife huge gardens. The beautiful lush green gardens are very big. The beautif stone boat statue in the water is very unique. The hall with the glass roof is beyond magical..
"We were really excited to visit Jefferson Memorial.  The location is amazing, sitting out on the Tidal Basin.  We visited it at night and took extra time to take in the views.    ,Apparently, there was a commission created to direct the erection of a memorial by an Act of Congress that was approved in June 1934. The present location on the Tidal Basin was selected in 1937.  The site received public criticism because it would result in the removal of Japanese flowering cherry trees. Also, there was controversy based on selection of the design of the Memorial. The Commission of Fine Arts objected to the pantheon design because they thought it it would compete with the Lincoln Memorial. The took the design controversy to President Franklin D. Roosevelt who preferred the pantheon design and gave his permission to proceed. Another reason to love FDR.  On November 15, 1939, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of the Memorial.  So, I guess it's true that you can't please all the people all the time.  And it's nice to have a president who can make important decisions!,I think the memorial design and location are both so amazing.  And be sure to take extra time to enjoy the views, examine the interior, read the inscriptions and enjoy the flowered wreath.  Makes me want to learn more about Jefferson and even visit Monticello."
"The Jefferson Memorial is one of the most iconic monuments in DC and not without reason.  Bordered by the Tidal basin, it is a very picturesque monument with a statute of Jefferson at its center flanked by several meaningful quotations around the inside of the monument.  The monument is open 24 hours and has a more extensive exhibit on it lower level about Jefferson and his accomplishments.  Definitely worth a visit...day or night."
"A must for any fan of American baseball. This is not only the oldest ball park in the states, but one of the smallest. Tickets sell out fast, but you can always pick one up on the day of the game from one of the many scalpers outside of the stadium. Tickets for Boston Red Sox vs NY Yankees are especially hard to come by, but well worth the effort to experience the energy that this long-standing rivalry generates."
"This is no way compares to the brilliance that is The Lincoln Memorial, but this place ranks up there.  It wasn't as crowded, and feels more intimate and secluded from the rest of the big DC landmarks.  The memorial itself is simply stated, and I guess that's the way it should be.  Be prepared to walk, as its a bit further away from the main parking areas."
"If you're visiting Miami, seeing Vizcaya is a MUST! Parking is free and there is plenty. Admission is $18, but if you bring your student ID it's only $10. It is closed on Tuesdays!,Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes as the walkways are uneven. They offer walking tours throughout the week for $5 but most people take self-led tours. There's space to picnic and plenty of photo ops. Vizcaya is a also a great venue for weddings and events!"
"I can only describe this office as some sort of bureaucratic Shangri-La made real.,Where else can you get a new social security number faster than Seamless can deliver a pizza!,Got there early in the morning and was on my way out in just over 30mins. Security and staff were both friendly and helpful.,DO: Have your documents ready beforehand and make it a pleasant experience for you and everyone around you. ,DON'T: Start making a scene and shout at the staff when you did not bring the correct documents. It's the government; when it comes to paperwork, resistance is futile."
"This is an incredible mansion with so much history. Great place for pictures and scenery. Absolutely beautiful! It's huge, so be ready to walk. Definitely an experience, everyone who's local should check it out. I've lived in South FL my entire life and this was my first visit, I'll be back with friends and family to show them one of Miami's best preserved treasures."
"OK so Fenway is a ""cute little nostalgic ballpark"" but what kills me is  a Yankees Suck Chant when they aren't even playing the Yankees!!!Come on guys get a grip!!-OK so I am from NY and grew up in a Mets family but could truly care less for baseball, unfortunately living in Boston has corrupted me and made me know things about baseball that i didn't want to know! Thanks again Boston, I am forever scarred!!!"
Such a beautiful estate and gardens. The tour of the first floor is really enlightening and makes the whole experience that much more interesting. The only drawbacks were the expensive prices in the  cafe and gift shop and the random tent set up for an event that was blocking our view of the ocean. Even the tour guide seemed pretty annoyed with the tent. Otherwise would definitely recommend for a 2-3 hour detour while you're in Miami.
"I'm in love with the Vizcaya mansion and grounds. I could go there every day of the month and still discover something new and beautiful. Each room in the mansion is filled with delicately selected furniture and art shipped from Europe. Everything from the carefully designed floor tiles to the beautiful ceilings is so amazing from an artistic point of view. ,There are often weddings and photo shoots on the grounds, and I definitely suggest that if you're looking for a great spot - this is it. ,** I would not suggest this as a place to take your children. Unless they are of age to appreciate the art."
"""You are so beautiful to meeee, can't you seee?"",Yeah this memorial is really that amazing. Knock off one star for the pain in the ass location but besides that it is ABSOLUTELY worth seeing, especially during Cherry Blossom season."
What can I say ...  fabulous park.  very impressive.
"I wold throw this place on your must do list while visiting Miami. While here I just paid the small fee to enter and browsed around. I didn't do any kind of tour just walked myself through this majestic old mansion. You could spend a good 45 minutes just walking around the interior but the outside gardens are just so expansive, almost felt like I was Alice in Wonderland. Lastly this is a great place for a photo op. To prove that point I must've seen a dozen quinceanera's while I was there."
"Lovely place. The museum is great. If you're able to join a tour they're quite informative and depending on the group can be a lot of fun. The grounds and surrounding gardens are stunning. Perfect place to explore or take photos. ,I've been there several times and it's the best place to take out of town visitors, always a hit ;)"
"Such a beautiful place!,Walking through the gardens you feel exactly as if you are in Europe. Every corner you turn, you'll want to take a photograph of something - at least, that's how I felt. Indoors, however, you aren't allowed to take photographs. But that's OK, soak up some history and learn something! It was incredible to see all of the history of the home and all of the details of the architecture. The ones that say that Villa Vizcaya is boring, are people who don't appreciate beauty and history. It took my parents and I about an hour and a half to do a complete walk through of the gardens and walk around the inside of the home. Definitely something you should squeeze in to your itinerary when visiting Miami, you won't regret it. ,PS: Admission is $18, but if you're a college student and show your ID it's only $10. Best $10 I've ever spent!"
Nice memorial.  It's October 2010 and there is some serious construction work going on the the front so it was a bit hard to get a good photo from the outside.  We drove to get here since it's not on the Mall and there is parking about 1/4 mile away but it's a prett walk because its on the water and you can see the other monuments from that side - very picturesque!
"I love the Jefferson Memorial. First of all, it's modeled after Monticello (I think), so it really fits Jefferson's character. The memorial has a free-standing statue of Jefferson and views out all of the sides of the dome. It sits right on the Basin, so it has beautiful views of the cherry trees and the water. This is such a tranquil and serene place, so I'm glad it's a bit tucked away. Honestly, if this place was swarming with tourists every day, it would be a lot less special (given I was most recently there during the cherry blossom festival, I think I can speak from experience). ,One note: do NOT walk from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial and then to here. Choose a less suicidal route and walk from the Washington Monument to here and then go back the way you came and go to the Lincoln Memorial via the Reflecting Pool. It's a much less roundabout route. We only walked around the Tidal Basin because of the cherry blossoms, but my feet were dead by the end."
"First time at Fenway last week and had a great time! It is an old stadium, like Candlestick or Yankee Stadium, but the fans are what gave this place 5 stars! In the middle of the 7th inning or something, everyone in the stands, hammered and not, start belting out ""Sweet Caroline"" by Neil Diamond. We, the tourists, start looking around like ""what's going on?"" It's sweet and only happens at this stadium. The fans were all nice and well behaved, no Raider Nation here. How can you hate a stadium who has a player named ""Coco Krispi"" on their roster? The food was pretty normal for a ballpark, I am too spoiled with edamame at Pac Bell Park. The bathrooms were clean and the lines weren't crazy. I missed out on some famous ice cream they have there, I was too full. But it's a great historic park to be at with true fans. Take the T ($2 each way however long you are going), it's only a 5 min walk from the stadium."
"I would rate this better than other memorials even the Lincoln. What a spectacular view of DC. The Potomac river adds to its beauty. Nevertheless, The contribution and influence of Jefferson on this nation is more than that could be confined within these walls. I happen to hear from others that this is one of the most under recognized and under appreciated place in DC and doesn't get as much as visitors when compared with Lincoln."
"great view, great food, YAY!"
"Sure it's touristy, but being a tourist, it was really really incredible to be up there, albeit a bit scary. One day I will make it back to Seattle try that revolving restaurant Sky City. What else can be said? It's a view that is totally worth the money. I like that there are those tours given every couple minutes, so you can learn a lot about the city."
"Everyone knows the Space Needle and it really is something you can't pass up if you're visiting Seattle. The observation deck is about 500 feet up, and is 360 degrees around with indoor and outdoor viewing. It is one of the best (and arguably number one) views of Seattle. The staff gives a quick little speech while you're in the elevator so you learn a bit about the history.  The hours of the Needle allow for day and evening visits. And you can really make an event out of it by having brunch, lunch or dinner up top. The restaurant actually rotates (slowly) around the observation deck which I'm sure would make for a unique dining experience. I personally have not eaten there though so I can't say anything about the food. It can also be really busy, so expect a line and plenty of other people."
"I liked this place especially the gardens. As you stroll, you see several groups doing fashion or wedding photography. The staff is friendly and helpful. However, the palace itself is small and OK. It is the house of a rich businessman! I mean if you have been to real palaces in Europe, you wont find this one very exquisite. The biggest turn off and reason I rated this place 3 is the hight price. It is $22 with no audio guide or anything. If you have endless time and money, you would probably enjoy this place. Otherwise, save your money for other fantastic places like Fairchild botanical garden."
The Space Needle is a must for any visitor to Seattle. The admission price is a bit steep but the spectacular views are worth it.
"Well, that was painless.  I am now Mrs. Caroline B. B!"
"SS Office that's actually worthy of 5 Stars? Here is why.,Star 1--Convenience:  It's literally a 20-second walk from A/C/J/Z/2/3/4/5 train!,Star 2--Friendliness:  From the building security to the window lady, everyone was polite, warm, and friendly.,Star 3--Clean:  Spacious, clean seats, clean bathroom, and sparkling white floor!  ,Star 4--Efficient:  Get a number from the number machine at the entrance, TV monitor display when your number is called on the speaker, submit all your paperwork to the window lady, and get your receipt then you're all set (took me about 10 minutes coming in an hour before their closing time).,Star 5--Location:  Located in the Financial District (instead of some sketchy neighborhood in the city), it is surrounded by plenty of eateries, drug stores, banks, and mail services..  ,Go on their website and prepare everything before you come in.  Highly recommend this SS Office if you ever need to go to one."
"What a beautiful place to spend the afternoon. Admission is $15. The Miami-Dade resident price of $10 is NO LONGER valid. We arrived a bit after 10am, and a long line had already formed on a Monday. They do offer free tours, we started one, but then dropped off and decided to explore on our own. The home (which looks like a castle) is amazing. The gardens go on forever. It would be nice to have a picnic here, but I don't think you can bring food/drinks inside. My in-laws loved it; I think this was the highlight of their trip to Miami. The views of the bay are outstanding. There were several brides there taking pictures."
"You have not experienced summer in Boston unitl you've been to a Sox game at Fenway. Sure the seats may be tiny and the prices may be outrageous, but no other park offers the  unique charm and excitment that fenway does. There is something special about the drunken cheers, the 7th inning stretch, chanting YANKEES SUCK when the Orioles are playing and singing Sweet Caroline, all traditions that no other park can offer."
Such a beautiful and peaceful place! A must see!
"A rare place where you feel transported to not only a different place but a different time. ,The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens used to be the winter residence of James Deering in the early 1900s and it was built with the help of over 1,000 workers from Europe and the Caribbean. It's probably safe to conclude that he was very wealthy. I, too, would like  winter home of this magnitude, but currently do not have the resources. ,With each step on the grounds, you seem to go back another decade in time. By the time you make it to the water, you think you're actually in Europe during the Renaissance. If you brought your camera, chances are you'll take at least one photo. If you didn't bring your camera, you'll be highly upset you didn't bring your camera. ,Whether it's the view of the bridges or the barge or from the massive Italian style gardens, you'll be amazed. It wasn't a surprise to see wedding parties having their photos taken here. You can easily spend hours here soaking in all the elements, particularly of the different gardens, like the Maze Garden or Secret Gardens. Exquisite detail not only in the overall layout, but the individual components, like the stones, statues, or water features. Make sure to explore every foot. Not only for it being picturesque, but also to actually achieve some peace and solitude. Which is pretty easy to find here. ,As of right now, there replacing the courtyard skylight. Despite the noise of the construction process, you can still appreciate the intricate and lavish decor. Incredibly beautiful. ,When I initially came down to Miami, this didn't factor into my plans. If you're in Miami, this should DEFINITELY factor into your plans. Though be warned afterwards you'll likely view your own abode as excessively inadequate. Damn you, Vizcaya!"
This was incredible to see the one that was a must see here in Dc. Although if you are walking around its a bit out of the way and recommend either the public rent a bike station or hop on hop off buses. I didn't see much of a place to park which was very limited. They have a gift shop and bathroom on the second floor that you can only access by elevator. It took a long time so we didn't have  a chance to go visit it but reading all famous quotes of Thomas Jefferson was more heartfelt then reading it from your 8th grade textbook. This one is worth the extra push out of the way!
"If you need to check Yelp to see whether or not you should visit Fenway Park, than you should probably just stay home."
"This place reminded me a bit of the people in one of the Oz books who had magnificent looking homes but only on the outside ... with the interiors being cold, stiff, and uncomfortable. Like someone else who wrote a negative review here, I can't imagine anyone actually living in the place.I think charging 18 dollars for admission to this place is seriously overcharging. I also agree that not allowing photography inside was a serious negative."
"So, so gorgeous. Not only is the house (pardon, giant mansion) really beautiful, the surrounding gardens are wonderful. Add to that, the first rule of real estate... location, location, location! This place is right on the water just south of Miami, in the near south part of Brickell.,I can't even imagine what this house, lot and location would demand on the market if it went on sale today. Even with the housing market having come back down to reality since 2008, I can't see this estate having an asking price of less than $80 million. Think about it, 70 rooms, 50 acres, killer views and location, unbelievable landscaping, ridiculous marble grotto pool...,Go visit and you'll see what I mean. This is baller-mode to the tenth power. That sounds like a cheesy way to describe it, but trust me that you'll agree and be at a lack for words when you see it for yourself.,Take your family, friends, and kids; they'll all enjoy it!"
The museum and the garden are nice. But the back to the museum they need to clean the bay so the tourists would keep enjoying the nature. Beside that the museum is beautiful completely.
"I walked to the Jefferson Memorial at night. And the walk is lovely. The memorial itself, when lit at night, is inspiring. But as much as I like pretty things, I am also a sucker for interpretive displays. So I headed downstairs.,And it was there that I found the fly in the ointment.,There seems to be a wee ventilation problem downstairs. The restrooms are located there. And their stench does not dissipate. ,I couldn't stay for the rousing music and displays...it all stank.,And now you are fore-warned."
"It's a memorial that I feel is better known for its view of the National Mall and DC than the memorial itself. The memorial is located next to the Tidal Basin where the heart of the cherry blossoms bloom. It's a beautiful spot to take pictures of the cherry blossoms and also offers a great view of the Washington Monument. The Jefferson Memorial itself is not much to look at though. The Jefferson statue is located in the middle of the rotunda and during the day is showered with the sun's rays. At night it glistens in the glowing lights that illuminate it on the inside.,If you are going to drive to the Memorial there is actually a private parking lot dedicated for it, which is quite surprising because the other memorials do not have any. It's a relief considering how hard it is to park in the area during the day when tourists flock to it. It's a nice memorial to take a picture of and better yet offers nice views of the basin, however it only requires 15-20 minutes of visiting time max."
"ok, i'm not a native bostonian and i actually do not like baseball.   however if you live in beantown you HAVE to go to a sox game, just have to!!   i give it a mediocre review because while the fans are something to experience (don't mess with them), the prices and overcrowded stadium are hassels that make it a once in a lifetime event for me."
"Off the beaten path of the typical sites for DC. But well worth it to check out. Was truly moving, and kind of a cool walk on the side of the Potomac river."
"Go right when they open and catch the first elevator to the view platform. Go outside and take a deep breath and enjoy the view...ahhhh. Crisp air and Puget Sound looks stunning from above. The view from up there made me want to move to Seattle so bad. I'm afraid of hights, but I couldn't peel myself away from the gorgeous view overlooking Mt. Rainier in the distance. Yes, it's touristy, but when in Seattle, go there, it's not too expensive."
"beautiful view of seattle... breathtaking actually..  ,the only problem... i was scared shitless... as i get older i noticed that i get more and more scared of heights... i mean i did the petronas towers in malaysia went all the way to the top.. and the space needle is only 40% of the size of the petronas and i was okay.. this one somehow freaked me out so as soon as i got up to the top.. i swiftly walked around the top..and went straight for the elevators to go down.. ,ahaha.. i felt like such a chicken shit.. but it's okay.. the view was still nice, i think i got scared because i noticed a small shift from the wind.. and it's true it does move a little...,the space needle is a must anyways..."
"It was raining when I went but the views were still fantastic. I was debating if I wanted to pay the $16 but in the end, I did cause I was a tourist in Seattle and it would be stupid of me not to have gone up and experience it so I did and I really enjoyed it.  Money well spent.   :)"
I always enjoy bringing visitor's here.  It is a Seattle icon and offers great views of the city.  Folks can also learn a lot about the area from the inside displays.
"""I would love to get married here!"" - I blurted these words out as I took in the breeze cooling my sweaty forehead as we walked out the side gardens to the backyard (which is essentially the part of the property facing the water). Gold chairs and arrays of bouquets were being setup for a wedding which was scheduled to take place that evening. ,Vizcaya is exactly how Rabia described it - a lavish 1920's estate preserved by James Deering and a venue Jay Gatsby would most definitely approve off for one of his grand ol' parties! ,This estate seems to fit in Miami's tropical weather and yet stand alone in a mysterious way due to its Italian Renaissance-style architecture. I came here primarily after being seduced by pictures I saw on a friend's Facebook and so glad I did! I still regret not being able to capture more of the beautiful villa in pictures due to the untimely (as always) death of my iPhone's battery."
"Once again, I'm a tourist in Seattle.  The Space Needle is yet another well known monument/structure/landmark that gives Seattle it's name.,I am afraid of heights!  Why did I pay a whopping $16 to go to the top of the O Deck?  I'm crazy!  It was worth the 360 views for photo ops.  Actually, we paid $15 because we used an expired coupon in the tour brochures that we picked up at the airport. =)  Probably the most expensive elevator ride I've ever paid for.,The views....all I can say is WOW as I grip the railings for my dear life.  It's very high up.  Enough to make me a little nervous.,Visit Seattle, visit the Space Needle!  It's worth the views and the plenty of photo opportunities."
"Cheesy as it is, it's like Nike: Just do it. ,You'll need to scrape up $17 just to say you went to the top and took some pictures. Despite the price I'm glad I went. ,Come on... it's Seattle!"
"Sort of disappointed by the good 'ol Space Needle.  I expected a little bit more WOW to it than what I got.  Sure, the outside view (looking up at the Needle) is quite impressive and makes for a good photo op, but the admission price of ($16 I think?) wasn't worth it, in my opinion.  Just seemed like looking out of a semi-tall building that made a round in a circle.  But hey, at least I now get to say I've ""made it to the top"".  ,I went here around mid-afternoon.  I bet the view is 100x better at night.  Love lights.  ,Three stars instead of two because hey, it's the Space Needle."
Friendly and quick.  Went there 10am Friday.  Waited 20 minutes.  Guard was friendly as was the customer service rep.   Was not expecting it to be so painless.
What can I say that hasn't already been said? Beautiful and breath-taking.   Love that there is this place of tranquility in the busy-ness of Miami.   I really enjoyed exploring all the nooks and crannies of the garden.   A great place to enjoy a lazy Sunday afternoon stroll.
Beautiful classic park. Mostly respectful fans. Mediocre concessions. Who could ask for more?
"The garden is the best part of Vizcaya, particularly so if one wants to sit and read under the lovely shades of trees and vines."
"Reminding me slightly of Villa Borghese in Rome, Vizcaya is easily one of the most romantic spots in Miami. While the house is lovely it's the garden that make my heart pitter patter.  ,A moonlit stroll through the paths automatically transports you elsewhere and you can't resist wanting to walk ever so slowly, lingering just a bit longer on every step, breathing in the mix of the nearby bay and the manicured greenery. It's impossible to not be enchanted and difficult to resist reaching out and grabbing that certain someone's hand. Nothing like a garden at night to make feelings bloom. ,Bring someone during one of the smaller nocturnal events, sit by a fountain or pick a quiet corner, and then to lift a lyric from Depeche Mode, ""Enjoy The Silence."",note** this is a review of the gardens at night"
"This place is a must see when visiting Miami.,The only thing I could compare it to is that it is like Mount Vernon in Virginia, but bigger and better, sorry George. ,I would like to come back again when they have the skylight finished."
"This memorial is beautiful; located right at the basin, if you go during Cherry Blossom season, i imagine it to be breathtaking. I could only wish i visited DC during that time to capture the falling petals of cherry blossom and the pink colored lake. ,I like the design of the Jefferson Memorial it's nice, very grand too. You can also see the washington monument from here as well as a tiny spec of the white house. ... beautiful view, indeed!"
This is literally one of my favorite memorials! This place is really breathtaking! PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS PLACE AT NIGHT ON ID4!!!! you will not understand what I mean until July 4th rolls around and you are on the steps of the Jefferson memorial enjoying the fireworks....
"So here it is Yelp posting number 100! I saved this posting because it is my favorite place in Boston, and maybe the world.  Fenway Park is what got me to come to Boston for law school and it is where most of my money since then has gone -- and oddly it doesn't bother me at all.  Coming from Minnesota (and the Metrodome) i never really knew what baseball was suppose to be like until last season when i went to my first Sox game -- and nothing has been the same since.  ,Fenway Park is one of the last great ball parks that doesn't need a flashy menu, or fireworks, or waterfalls to make people come.  Just give us the Sox, Wally and a sunny evening and you will see 37,000 otherwise cranky Bostonians all unified for one cause.  Part of me does agree that Fenway has more bad seats than any other park and the price of seats, parking and a dog at the game is enough to make some of us take out small loans, but there is something magical about an evening on the corner of Landsdown and Yawkey Way.  There is something magical about standing with 37,000 people chanting Manny, Manny to a guy who we also hold our breathe for when the most routine fly balls are hit to him.  There is something special about singing ""Sweet Caroline"" in the 8th Inning (which is a tradition that everyone else has seemed to copy).  Most of all there is something special about a place where we all go to leave our adult lives for an evening and cheer like we were 12 years old (of course that can present a problem in the bleacher seats after too many beers).  If Yelp had 11 stars, Fenway would get 12 from myself and about 3 million other loyal Red Sox fans.  ,If you are a baseball fan and you have not been to Fenway yet - then you have missed a lot of what baseball is really about."
"This place is beautiful!,Self guided tours and a glimpse of how the elite bourgeois lived at the turn of the century. Beautiful interiors, rich with history. Lush, landscaped gardens. ,Definitely really hot and packed in the Summer. Going during the cooler months would be recommended as the mansion is not air conditioned and this was a winter home for the original owners.,Self-guided and headset tours are available. Definitely recommend!"
"This is probably the best hidden gem in Miami!  This awe inspiring locale is incredible not only in its architecture, landscaping and antiquities throughout, but it is a man-made paradise to gawk at.  Vizcaya is probably the most photographed location in South Florida.  This place is literally hidden and not easy to find, but once there, you'll spend hours gazing at the both man-made and natural beauty all over.  No matter how much you  study it in advance of your visit, it will not prepare you for the spectacular and exciting views, incredible natural fragrances and sensations it strikes you with.  If you don't visit here, you've really not enjoyed Miami!"
Such a lovely place!! They are closing on Tuesday. The house is small and it only takes about 30minutes for the self tour but i really enjoyed the gardens.
"Right up there with the Lincoln Memorial in my opinion.  It's further away from the main action and therefore less crowded.  I ended up there on a cold November night and was the only person there.  As with the other memorials, go there at night, it looks so impressive with the lighting."
"There's a bit of construction going on near the entrance of the memorial so that was a bummer. It's incredible at night, much more beautiful than during the day. ,The location is a drawback though - so far from the rest of the memorials. But the walk along the tidal basin is spectacular at night, with the reflections of the Washington Monument and Jefferson memorial. Personally, I liked Lincoln a lot more (and thus I spent more time there)."
"Ok, I grew up in suburban California where the streets are wide, bland, and singularly depressing (good excuse to start a crack habit though).  Everything from taco stands to baseball stadiums is surrounded by anywhere from 1 to 50 square miles of parking.  So when I was in Boston, this was a switch for me and Fenway was the first really urban ballpark I'd been to (at the time the Giants were at Candlestick and the A's ... well, we'll leave that unsaid).  The trippy thing was that I didn't know I was next to the ballpark at first.  I thought I was walking next to a warehouse until I realized that yes indeed, I was standing right next to Fenway Park!  It was March and so the season hadn't started yet but I decided to walk the perimeter and when I got 'round to where Center Field was I realized that they had left the back gate open and there I was looking all the way to home plate.  What's a boy to do?  :-)  Of course I walked right in.  I milled about under the bleachers, went up into them for awhile and then got brave enough to actually set foot on the Center Field grass myself (that would be the closest equivalent of church for me).  That portion of the journey didn't last long as I was suddenly quite visible and taking pictures of everything and soon I heard some shouts and observed 4-5 fairly large maintenance types closing in on me.  Not wanting trouble I slipped out the back fence again but what a magical moment that was.  I will have to go back for a game one day but I'll always remember Center Field."
I think the Jefferson Memorial is the most beautiful of them all.  The view from across the water is amazing and on the right day the reflection of the Washington Monument in the water is incredible.  Be sure not to  miss this amazing site in DC.
"The space needle is definitely something you have to do in Seattle.  I have been to the top at night and during the day and the view is wonderful.  However, having seen it now, I don't think I would spend $16 to go up to the top again very often.  Impressive to see though!"
"this was a breath-taking experience.  it was so easy.  we didn't even have to wait in a line longer than 5 minutes.  for $16 per person it was really worth it especially if it's a first time visit to seattle.  we lucked out and had terrific weather....few clouds in the sky, about 60 degrees...no rain.  it was nice.  the 40 second elevator ride up was much quicker than we thought and having a tour guide point out spots as we headed up was a perk.  once we got to the top we felt really comfortable...there is a huge area to hang out with tables to get coffee, drinks and snacks and enjoy the view from indoors....that was nice and we enjoyed that after we went out to the viewing deck area.  we enjoyed reading about the history of the space needle and felt very secure up there even though it is basically on a little pole, unlike the empire state building where i felt a little wobbly.  it was a great panoramic view of the city, safeco field, qwest stadium, puget sound, queen anne, lake union, u-district area....it was gorgeous.  mt. rainier was visible and we enjoyed the view of that as well.  the tourists weren't pushy up there and were friendly enough to offer to take pics of us together.  we enjoyed it so much we did not want to leave as we spent a couple hours easily up there."
"It's an icon, so you have to go once.,But everything is overpriced and kitschy, and equally or more impressive views can be had from Columbia Tower or Kerry Park or Gas Works or..."
"its touristy. its 'spensive. but you cannot beat the view. ,sigh,ride the elevator up late in the afternoon and stick around for the sun to set. you'll get beautiful light for taking pics and get to see the city lights wink at you from the world below. ,Do not eat here it is expensive as 'eff and there is almost nothing for vegetarians. The gift store is full of typical gifts and overpriced shirts (check out the phallic salt and pepper shaker set. I CANT BELIEVE THEY'RE SELLING THAT. Mom L gasped and looked away. SO GREAT!!!!)  we valeted our white whale of a van, there's some deal for up to 4 hours (i think) after that the price doubles. don't get bent over the counter, set your cell's alarm."
"It's a must-do.  Naturally I did it on one of my first weekends here with all the other Seattle noobs.,It's wasn't as tall as my experience at the World Trade Center (and nothing is now, I guess), but it's high and you can see more.  It was built to be an observation deck after all, wasn't it?,I think it's just as tall as it needs to be.,Drinks can, naturally, be purchased from the Starbucks at the top.  Being hundreds of feet in the air just isn't as good without some iced coffee or something, I am sure."
"Vizcaya stands today in historical testament to the time when the captains of American industry ruled and amassed great wealth.  Vizcaya was built in the style of Italian Renaissance by John Deering, whom had earned his wealth from the development of a harvester machine that enabled farmers to vastly multiply their productivity, and thus generate more profit.  Deering spent a considerable amount of time acquiring art, furniture, and antiquities during his travels in Europe of which now adorn the beautiful room of Vizcaya.  The estate is a must see for visitors and residents alike, as its a home very unusual to find in the US.  Pictures are not permitted inside, so one must be sneaky and quick.  The gardens a beautiful and you'll likely spend more time warning throughout the gardens then you will inside the home."
The only way to avoid the $18 entrance fee for the viewing platform is to go to the restaurant (which has a minimum spend policy) and then leave without ordering and conning the lift operator that you've just eaten. Great view but no way I would have spent $18.
"So, I've lived in Seattle my whole life and this is the first time I've traveled the 600ft up this UFO with stilts. It's pretty pricey at $17/head. Even more pricey when you realize you can walk the needle in about 10 min. They do have outside cameras which you can manipulate and zoom into adjacent neighboorhoods with which is fun. I recommend going on a sunny windless day. Don't be like the short bus riders as myself and go on a day that is 45 degrees and raining. Regardless still a great view of our beautiful city."
"Yep. Basically as so many other reviewers have said, it's horrible but kind of a must for tourists hence the two stars. The building itself is kind of dirty, the ticket/elevator crowds take forever, and once you are on top, the view is pretty so-so. I don't think the Seattle skyline is as spectacular as in some other cities (sorry Seattle people, not trying to offend you!) ,Still, you should go and just treat it like a band-aid. A quick visit, a few pics and your touristy self can feel fulfilled that you knocked yet one more spot off your list."
"Excellent. No wait when you go early in the morning, during mid-week. I went to change my name because I got married."
"I went to Jamaica office before but that old clerk lady made me go back home because I didn't bring my married certificate for new Social Security card even I have my passport, my work permit, my green card. It should be enough right? it was wasting my time for that place. ,Then  I went to this office. They let me it very respectful, long line but very fast. I gave the clerk same thing at i gave the old lady in Jamaica office. He don't need to see my married certificate. He just check on the computer and he saw all of my document that proof why my last name it different. I prefer Social Security card Center in Manhattan better than Jamaica."
"As a long time resident of Miami and thoroughly enjoying life in South Florida I a bit mortified that my first instinct is to give Vizcaya an Average to Low mark - As I attempt to write a review about this place I constantly remind myself that I need to be objective and somewhat disregard my own feelings, memories and such.,The bottom line is that if you find yourself in Miami this place is certainly worth a visit on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Having said that we must also put the place in context and realize that there is nothing historical about it, just a good example of what loads of money can buy, we thank Deering for having it built, furnishing it and giving it away to the City of Miami.,Anyway, if you can ever get yourself invited to any of the parties the host here it will be the best way to enjoy this place.,The renaissance festival in the spring was super cool, but they did away with it so Jeers."
Beautiful park!  Very intimate.  Lively surrounding bar scene after the game.
"Came here for a night time wedding and it was amazing!! The grounds are gorgeous and there is a cool half-sunken gazebo which you definitely need to see! Also came here once during the day, and the gardens are beautiful. This is a magical place."
"If you ever decide to venture off the beaten path and slow your pace while in MIA, I highly suggest visiting. The mansion and gardens have been host to several movies, the statues and secret nooks will mesmerize you as you walk around wishing you could stay forever. One of my favorite places in the US!"
"This is one of those take your breath away experiences. When I turned the corner to get a view of the gardens, ocean, and stained glass window, I was surprised how over-the-top this place is. It's a mansion built in the early 1900's with heavy european influence, but with a Floridian spin. It was the best $15 that I've spent in a while.,The gardens have a rustic feel; some parts need a little touching up, but in general they are amazing. Every corner you turn there is something completely different - from a maze to a Florance-style canal. That's all I can say (don't want to ruin it).,The view of Biscayne Bay is pretty sick.... very cool with the bridges and sculptures in the water. ,The house itself doesn't disappoint; amazing all around. Each room could independently furnish a regular house from top to bottom. The art collection is stunning. Be sure to read the blurbs in each room, they aren't unnecessarily wordy and provide a lot of context. My favorites - the library, sitting room, and music room.,Wish the bowling alley was still around and the basement was open :("
"All the DC memorials are very impressive but the Jefferson seems more tranquil especially later in the day.,It is less crowded that the other memorials and overlooks the Tide Basin.,It is a little tricky to get to and requires quite a bit of walking but it is 100% worth the effort.,There is a gift shop, bathrooms and disabled access in the basement.,Sitting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial is a great way to ""waste"" an hour :)"
"I can't NOT give Fenway 5 stars. After visiting a few other baseball stadiums, there's just no comparison. Fenway Park is an institution. You don't come to Fenway for luxurious seats, nice fans, or a cheap night out. ,You come to Fenway for the experience. The fiercely loyal fans, the chaotic insanity that is Yawkey Way, the cramped seating, all of it. ,Yes, it's expensive. Seats come at a premium there, and John Henry knows this. Most newer stadiums can hold a TON more people. At Fenway, you pay to sit close to the field, and not 3rd level balcony, where you need binoculars to even see the batter. ,If we ever move from this area, Fenway will most likely be THE most missed part. There's just no comparing it to the other newer, generic, sterile ballparks out there. We don't need fancy fountains and restaurants, we're happy with our Fenway Franks and the Cask."
"BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! bring your student ID so that you get a discount! yahoo!,no photos allowed inside :( but out and about the gardens you can and it is just wonderful! make sure you bring your strong legs because there will be a lot of walking. I don't think this place is handicap friendly, but if you have small children, prepare to eventually carry them. The inside of the mansion/palace/dream home is absolutely huge and there's just so much to take in! prepare your mind to wander and imagine what life wouldve been living there. sigh*,no food or drinks allowed also. bring sunglasses, wear comfortable shoes, dont forget the camera, possibly put some sunscreen on a sunny afternoon before you go."
"I've been here both times I've been in Miami because it is so beautiful! They have done a great job restoring and telling the history of the property. Plus the garden's are just gorgeous. The second time we went there was a HUGE lizard out in tea room that we thought was fake until we got closer. I give 4 stars because I wish there was an upstairs tour as well. There are also just so many doors that we you can't see into. I'm always the person wanting to know what is behind those doors and there isn't anyone to ask! ,As a huge Iron Man fan, it was fun to go and see the location again because I recognized Vizcaya when I saw the movie and had no idea that it was going to be in the film. Since the first time I went they had added the cafe and gift shop downstairs by the pool which was fabulous and the food was exceptional. I will definitely be back when I have the opportunity :)"
"Um I would just like to add that I just saw Iron Man 3 and the entire opening into the Miami scenes was at Vizcaya. I kept wanting to whisper yell ""I've been there!"" at every shot, but refrained (mostly).,If this place is good enough for Iron Man, it's good enough for you. Now give me a scotch, I'm starving."
"I, like most UVA alumni, hold a special place in my heart for the Jefferson Memorial. It is a spectacular sight, especially when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom."
This place is one of the most popular place I like going to. Walking around the Tidal Basin. Watching all the people walk by. People sitting on the grass. And what season it is. People eating out on the grass with there family. People bike riding. People in boat in the basin. The Jefferson Memorial been there when I was a little up to now. I alway love coming here. With the gifts stores down stairs. Even a place to eat near by. But the price is to high for being in Washington.  I wood come back for the memory and see the history of owner country.
"There is no greater place to watch a sporting event in this country. No, Fenway does not have cushy seats to pad your tender behind. No, there are no waterfalls or windmills or any other gimmicky eyesore in centerfield. No, they aren't going to serve you fine imported beers from around the world. It's a ballpark in every sense of the word and forces you to focus soley on the game being played, rather than the ""experience"" of a brand new stadium. Every baseball fan should make a pilgrammage to this venue at least once in their lifetime; good luck getting a ticket."
"Jefferson's statue has curly pretty hair and he's wearing this fancy French-ish get-up --  not as pouffy as Seinfeld's shirt, but close.  This week, the memorial is surrounded by delicate pink & white cherry blossoms.  It's all very girly. It complements the more 'masculine'  Washington Monument.,The words here are brilliant, but visit Monticello to glimpse TJ's less attractive side: his extravagant spending, enormous personal debt, and his holding of slaves.  I recommend Joseph Ellis's bio American Sphinx , - a fascinating read."
"Its over priced, yes its a tourist spot and almost venture to say tourist trap because of the price.  You can't really go to Seattle and not do it.  On a clear day it makes it more worthwhile because you can see everything in 360 degree view.  If its cold, your time outside will be limited especially when you can't see too much.  Surprisingly, the food and drink on the observation deck is really not expensive.  They could have charged you less to get up and more to drink and no one would say anything.  Good view of downtown, the Sound, suburban Seattle, Mt. Ranier (if its clear) and capital Hill."
"My experience with the space needle is, I think, a bit of a unique one: I went to the top of it once, a few years ago on my first visit to Seattle.  It was dead winter, and my friend and I only went because she had worked there the summer before, and knew the elevator operators who let us ride to the top for free.  There was absolutely no line because the day was so dismal, and we were two of only a handful of people wandering around in the glass-enclosed deck.  The view was less than spectacular, simply because the sky was dark with clouds.  And yet, I think this was more or less the perfect way to experience the space needle: there wasn't a lot of pushing or shoving.  It was neat to be almost alone in one of Seattle's landmarks, and to just be able to walk around, and look out into the sky.  I even enjoyed the minor claustrophia of the surrounding clouds; it made me feel really close to the city.  All in all, a lovely experience.,But I would never go during the summertime, when the wait and the hassle and the heat would make the experience unbearable, and definitely cheapen the view."
"View : 5 stars , but waiting to get up and down from the tower: 0 star. Waited 40-50 mins each way just to get into the elevator."
"it's how much????,i don't care.  it has a great view.  and it's cool.,i loved it."
"Seattle's own Eiffel Tower, sort of. It is a mixture of a space ship and a hypodermic needle and you can see if from pretty much anywhere in Seattle. A nice reminder of where your at. It also adds to the skyline and the sweeping mountains surrounding the city. Makes for a great photo opp."
"The tower is a must see for any tourist, but I would recommend the Columbia Center for a better view of the mountains and a cheaper price. At $17 dollars that is a bit much for just a view and a pat on the back."
"You can never go wrong with Vizcaya. So much history and so much to look at. Great for taking pictures, staff is friendly....cafe is great...i wish they would bring back the conch fritters! Ive gone there many times just to stroll through the gardens. Very peaceful and relaxing."
"it's an expensive ride to the top, but if you're lucky enough to hit it at sunset/dusk on a gorgeous clear summer day then it's well worth the price!"
"Since I am watching the SN with its lovely spinning top at this moment looking forwards to the new years how tomorrow I currently have extreme love for this Seattle Landmark.,Please don't worry about the price when you come from out of town, every awesome thing in other cities costs a fortune, why can't our little needle swindle some extra cash of its own???,Food on top is ehhh. Go there for the experience for sure."
"Vell, the Space Needle's just zis big useless thing, you know?,At $16, the Space Needle is probably not worth the money (particularly given the difficulty in finding a sunny day to go up in it). You can really only spend about 20 minutes there before your attention span runs out. Kerry Park will give you a similarly beautiful view of downtown (including the photogenic Needle) for free!,Being up on top gives you a really good idea of the neighborhood layout of Seattle, the scope of Elliott Bay, and the location of Mt. Rainier, the Olympics and the Cascades. Also, there's a pretty cool interactive screen inside where you can turn a knob and see a minute-by-minute panoramic photo of the view for 24 hours. Also, the Needle has lots of telescopes, good for... spying on people in Kerry Park?,The best part of the Space Needle Experience™ is the Amazingly Tacky Gift Shop, selling such beautiful and thoughtful gifts as a small plush orca, encased in a pink plush purse, embroidered with the Space Needle Itself. Oh, the humanity."
"If in Seattle.. its a must.,whats the price now?  12 bucks right?,On a good day (clear and sunny) the view is amazing!!!  ,Even has a resturant on top to eat at.,To me its worth it if you stop by Seattle."
"Came here to get a replacement Social Security Card.,I came on a Monday Morning at around 8:45 AM.,I tried to get there early as I thought that there would be a long wait.,The office is located on the 3rd floor.,When I got there, there was no line.  I got my number from the kiosk to the left and I was in and out in 10 minutes.  ,It must be a good Monday!!"
"Easy to get to and fascinating story behind the property. We went on the day they have their once a year fundraising to maintain the property as a public museum so lots of setting up and equipment got in the way of exploring every crevice.,It's such a beautiful place with amazing items that I wish i could take pictures of but I know would compromise the integrity of the paintings and other curated items. I wanted to so badly give this place 4-5 stars but I think a museum like this thrives on its tour guides and I really felt that this area was supremely lacking in quality and energy. So much so that I wanted to try to get a job as a guide only to find out it's volunteer based...which made me realize that tour guides would be a hit or miss depending on the volunteers."
"Besides a cup of beer costing a whopping $6.50 I have nothing to complain about especially since we are talking about Boston.  I saw my first MLB game last Friday night and couldn't have been happier.  After consuming my beer I had to pee twice throughout the game and both times there was no line to get into the women's bathroom! I realize that the male to female ratio of a Red Sox game don't exactly meet eye to eye, however, I was still wicked impressed.  Also my seat was definitely not the best in the park but I had no problem seeing all the action on the playing field.  Overall my favorite part of Fenway would have to be the manually operated scoreboard. Now how cool is that!?"
"This place sort of remind me of Hearst Castle in S. Ca. Although it's not quite as stunning as Hearst Castle, it's still worth checking out. There are guided tours, but you can also wander around the area on your own which is what my husband and I did. Pictures aren't allowed inside, but if you keep your distance from the tour guides and keep and eye out for the security guards and can take a pic fast without flash, go for it! I can't find the pics I took of the ship outside, but others did thankfully and the place is just stunning!,Anyways, the inside of the place is beautiful and the rooms look like something out of a medieval castle. There are only two levels. The rest of the place is closed off to the public. Outside the garden is stunning and looks sort of like a maze. The most impressive thing about this place is the ship carved from stone outside. It's a huge ship out in the water out in the back. It was just stunning. The day we were there, a wedding was going on. Wow, what a romantic spot to have a wedding at. We saw the bride outside and it felt like we were witnessing a celebrity wedding, but we weren't. Not as far as I could tell anyways, lol."
"Truly an amazing property. My company rented Vizcaya for a dinner party. We arrived about an hour before dark which allowed us to walk the gardens and take in this absolutely gorgeous property. We only had access to the atrium and the side room leading out to the gardens and it left me wanting more. I did peak into the music room and also the front room. Very beautiful. ,Our dinner was in the back of the house overlooking the bay - stunning. ,I would love the opportunity to visit this property in the daytime and explore it from top to bottom."
"The Memorial itself is awesome. There is an excellent view back over the tidal basin onto DC. If there's a downside, it's that it's a bit harder to get to. The nearest metro station is a 15 minute walk. You can keep walking along the same path and reach the FDR memorial and more cherry blossoms.,Enjoy the architecture, the museum in the base, the inspirational/though provoking quotations all around the monument, activate the purifier to safe the capital wasteland (wait what). Definitely a must see."
This was the most fun I've ever had at a baseball game. Fenway is just so legendary and there really isn't a bad seat in the place. The atmosphere was great. The fans swept you up in their love of the Red Sox and you can't help but be caught up in it. We were singing Sweet Caroline and left new found citizens of the Red Sox nation.
"My daughter discovered this unique place when researching what to do in Miami other than water fun.  Although this place was built in the early 1900's the rooms have the look and feel of many European castles we have visited. But encased in a building with a Spanish Colonial feel, especially the stunning courtyard in the center. Then you step onto the back terrace and are greeted by an unusual sculptured pier reminiscent of Roman or Greek ruins with a stunning view of the ocean. Then off to the side of the house are the beautiful gardens. Though you're surrounded by the insanity that is the city of Miami you truly feel a world apart when sitting or strolling here. Beautiful!  Easy to get to and well worth a visit."
"If you travel to Miami, you simply must pay a visit to Vizcaya! Spend several hours touring the mansion and the grounds and have a beer or a wine in the shade of the beautiful trees in the garden. If you appreciate architecture or art/history even a little, you'll love it here. Headphones for a guided tour are available, but I loved discovering the hidden treasures on our own. When in the gardens, get off the most used paths and find the quiet places- you'll be glad you did!"
"I had an absolutely terrible experience visiting this museum! One of the volunteer guide conducting paid tour around the museum yelled at me and my friends in front of other people. The reason was the fact that we were talking while she was talking. First of all, we were talking to each other quietly. Second, it was a big hall and it is illogical to forbid people who did not signed for the tour to communicate with one another! It was very humiliating to hear that volunteer, an old lady, yelling at us with a angry grimace. That museum, who charge quite a pricy admission fee, should be hiring professional and welcoming volunteers, who can make the tourists' experience enjoyable. I am supper disappointed about this museum. The fact that you cannot take photos inside of it doesn't help either. I do not recommend this place to anyone and I regret coming here."
"This was the fourth tourist stop in D.C. for my uncle, dad, and myself. And without a doubt, it was well worth it even if it was one super long walk to check it out. Note to self: do not walk several miles in Chucks. Your feet, legs, and back will hurt afterwards.,Thomas Jefferson was a great architect, philosopher, and politician. His political philosophical writings still resonate with people today. The idea that ""all men are created equal"" and the ""separation of church and state"" have helped make the United States what it is today. And most importantly, he was the man behind the ""Louisiana Purchase,"" which helped give the U.S. one of the greatest parties ever, ""Mardi Gras"" in the heart of New Orleans. ,Sure, he was flawed, especially his controversial views on Native Americans and his alleged affair with his quadroon slave, and possible half sister of his late wife, that he never freed and helped produce 4 children, which he did free. But for the most part, his writings concentrate on what was important to (Jeffersonian) Democracy. But what man isn't? More on that later. ,Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a great admirer of Thomas Jefferson, so he helped erect the Jefferson Memorial, which features both a dome (Roman inspired) and vertical columns (Greek inspired). Aside from the beautiful architecture, the Jefferson Memorial is surrounded by water, which it makes the experience of seeing his particular memorial very scenic. Since it sort of far off from other D.C. tourist spots, people forget about it or are too lazy to walk over to see it, so the crowds are minimal (as compared to the Lincoln Memorial). ,A bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson is the in the middle. Quotes from Jefferson's writings can be read all over the memorial and this makes it interactive. I enjoyed the excerpts of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson really tried to focus on what was to be very important for a forward thinking country like the United States. ,Personal flaws aside, Thomas Jefferson was a great man who knew what was important for the U.S. And we, as a nation of different people, need to realize what is important. With serious problems like mounting debt, health care, and the never ending war - why are we so concerned with the numerous mistresses Tiger Woods may or may not have? ,We should leave him alone and stay out of the business of his (and of course, his wife). 200 years from now, if the world still exists, he'll just be remembered as one of, if not, the greatest golfer ever. He had his share of personal issues, but so did Thomas Jefferson. And in the end, those personal issues become almost irrelevant over time. ,So focus on what's important. Leave Tiger alone and just look forward to the eventual adult film, starring a black adult film actor dressed as a nerdy golfer plowing through numerous Caucasian porn actress, some of which might be some Tiger's ""friends"" playing themselves, that will most likely be cleverly titled, ""Tiger's Wood."" ,Pass out the beer, beads, and put this film on and well, that sounds a like a Mardi Gras party to me. ,With all of that said, thank you Thomas Jefferson for the Declaration of Independence Louisiana Purchase, and Mardi Gras. Those are gifts that keep on giving."
"I went straight for the top to see the statue of Jefferson.,It was okay... I don't know what I was expecting but at least I got to see it."
"We walked from the Washington Monument to the Jefferson Memorial and it is a long walk! However, we saw beautiful cherry blossoms along the way. When we got to the Jefferson Memorial it was worth the long walk. We also saw the Jefferson Memorial from a distance at sunset during our trolley tour. Our tour guide was fun and he said he wasn't a big fan of Jefferson due to him owning slaves. But he was a big fan of Washington and Lincoln. The architecture of all the memorials were amazing."
"Fenway park is an amazing historical site to visit if you're in Boston.  It is the host of the champion Red Sox team.  Fenway has a great atmopshere with lots of commotion, fenway franks, over-priced beer, and sticky seats.  The food here is the best though, I'd recommend a pretzel and a fenway frank.  Merchandise is very expensive inside the stadium, but if you go down the street a bit, you'll find less expensive vendors with the same merchandise.  The stadium is set up really well, I went to a game a few days ago and had bleacher seats, but soon realized every seat in the house is a good one, because the stadium is so small each area has a great view of the field. Lots of cool bars nearby too."
"Absolutely beautiful memorial right on the tidal basin. My personal favorite memorial and like all of them, it is even better at night."
"The Seattle Space Needle is dwarfed by many of the downtown Seattle office buildings and hotels, but it still stands out as the landmark it is and it helped us find our hotel day after day on the twisted streets of Seattle that go one way, then two ways, then one way again, and then hang a sharp left for no reason whatsoever. I decided the city planner must have been on some nice drugs when he/she planned the city streets. Holy Cow!,But back to the Needle. You can't visit Seattle and NOT go up. So just do it. Granted you get great views from every hillside and even better ones from the ferries, but it doesn't matter. If you're a tourist, fork over the $$ and ride the elevator to the top."
"Very good experience. I am mostly writing this review to bring up one pointer: Get reservations to the restaurant at the top of the needle. ,Why I say this? We thought about it but decided to go to a local restaurant to save some cash. Here is the financial breakdown: ,Minimum per person in the restaurant: $35,WHAT YOU GET: Admission to the space needle, parking pass and your food. ,Space needle admission is: $18 ,Parking: $10,Food anywhere in the area: AT LEAST $10 per person,The view up there is awesome and this way you aren't just ""site seeing"" you are able to really soak it up too."
"went at night the view amazing.,i've been before when i was younger.,closes at midnight which is nice! You can enjoy the view with someone & just chill"
"I am going to give this two stars but I was contemplating one star. It is not worth the price of admission. I traveled to a few beautiful locations in Seattle that had amazing views; they were free and did not let you out at the gift shop. If you fill like you want to experience it, pay the $20. I could have had two drinks for that price. Not thrilled at all."
"To understand the Space Needle you need to see it all the time.  To me it is a beacon of ideals, fun, and rain...,it does cost money to go to the top... and if you do, take a local who can point out fun things they can see from above.  The restaurant is pretty tasty too... if you like to eat while going in slow circles (yes it rotates).,If you are looking for the true story behind why the needle blinks I highly suggest you read ""The Weedle on the Needle"" or at least become familiar with a story that every life long Seattleite can recite:"
Great view of the city. You can stay as long as you want and they have a deli upstairs if you get a little hungry. Theres' cool interactive things to do for adults and kids . I probably stayed for an hour before I was bored. The weather was a little chilly so I wasnt able to stay out as long as i wanted. But we got great pictures to show off to all of our friends. Worth the $20 admission which comes with a free photo that you can instantly download to your phone. Pretty cool!
Been up here a couple times; it's pretty cool view and gets really windy at the top. I wouldn't suggest eating there unless you got some money to spend because the restaurant is quite expensive and actually rotates. If you come to Seattle you MUST visit the Space Needle.
"The Space Needle is definitely a must-do activity--once. I feel like the views going down Denny (Seattle buildings, a view of the Needle, the water, the Olympics and islands, etc.) and across the bridges (water all around you, the Cascades, trees, etc.) better encapsulate the Seattle experience than the view from the top. Taking in the city these other ways also beats paying the ridiculous entrance fee--which happens to be more expensive then, say, going up the Eiffel Tower."
"Don't do it!!! $16 for boring? I shouldn't rail on another cities attraction, but seriously? The view was ok, maybe i just didn't get it, but I could have found many other things to do with $16 in Seattle."
i thought it woulda been better. but it was fun. i remember coming here when i was 4y/o. it looks soooooo much better at night time :) check the pix out in the gallery i posted. took it with my camera phone. not too bad :)
"Like others, I liked going up in the Space Needle, but it's a little disappointing.  I went during early Spring, so it was freezing/windy/cloudy/etc.  Definitely better to go when it's warmer and you can see farther.  For the price, you hope for something more than a view.  If it had been just a little cheaper, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars for the view.  I will probably go up it again when it's a nice day, but I might try what someone else recommended on here--the Columbia Center."
"Well me and my husband finnaly gave in and hit the Space Needle for dinner last week.,Service and obviously the dining atmosphere was nice, however the menu was lacking options, and the pricing was definetly still too high even for the elevation and view premuium which comes with dining there.,Would recommend checking out the observation deck instead of the over priced dinig exp."
"The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens is a truly picturesque location. ,My bestie C* is the one who went in and took the photos (while I stayed in the air conditioned car and battled mosquitos - she battled the heat and sweat, heh) ,- this is C*'s rendition of her ""journey"" - ,After buying the tickets, I walked up the pathway, already sweating from the glorious heat (thank you Miami weather in April) and was glad to find the entrance of the Museum to be nice and cool (yay for AC :D) but unfortunately, photography is not allowed within the museum. After walking and reading the various information on the artwork and the decor of the interior, I found myself gazing at water. Such PRETTY WATER! The back patio of the Museum opened up to a scenic view of the ocean where I hurriedly snapped photos as fast as possible to avoid the heat. After stumbling upon the gardens, I found it too crowded for my taste and began exploring the non-crowded areas. Towards the back end of the garden, there were a few flights of stairs going up to a large cleared area with a beautiful view of the gardens below it. I felt such serenity and peace while walking around (and thanking the trees for giving me a cool breeze + shade). ,Definitely a lovely spot to come and take photos for your quinceanera, engagement or wedding! (I spotted the most loveliest girl in a poofy pink bejeweled dress taking photos in the gardens with her parents that day - I was quite envious, heh). ,Overall, if it wasn't for the heat, I would've surely enjoyed it a lot more. (and also if I was with more people - walking around by myself can be quite boring LOL) "
"I feel underwhelmed.  I was all excited to go and see Seattle's noteworthy landmarks.   We took what seemed like a quick, super-jet elevator ride up to the top and then feasted my eyes upon the sights, which was a lovely 360 view of the city.  There's bars on this?  Oh yeah, safety first!  Definitely lovely water view and downtown view.  I think I would have enjoyed looking at the Needle itself from another building or maybe at nite to be in total awe.  All I have to say is ""check"" and ""next""."
"Space needle- a must see! Beautiful place , beautiful city ! that's why there's a movie-- sleepless in Seattle! Me and hubby went around the city,  taking lots of pictires but we got to eat on top of the space needle restaurant. The restaurant was swirling around while eating dinner. First this elevator had to take u 150 feet from below to get to the resto. I stepped into the circle ground and my feet started moving to the right, haha amazing! a rotating resto!"
"Havent been here for along time. I came back to the Emerald City for a visit and everythings changed. The city itself is really nice but the Space Needle, i wouldn't take for it. Parking was $20, the tickets were $18 for Ages 13-18ish... Come on now.. You would barely spend less than an hour up there for that rate. The employees are very rude. Overall ti was a great view and the store was very nice. Just not worth the money"
"Good office, smooth transaction, and friendly staff. Tip for the early birds: if you are not THE first one there, you may have a bit of a wait because at 7am (time they open) I think they only staff one or two agents and with an average time of 10 minutes per customer, it can take a while. ,For instance, I arrived at 7:10 and was the 10th person there. So all in all, it took me about 45 minutes to be called and then it was all of 5 minutes to order my replacement card. ,Net/net: Recommend either getting there before open time to hope to be first or go at a slightly later time when they are more staffed up. ,Cheers!"
"Even though I had to miss this year's Halloween Sundowner, let me share a few notes about this place. Clearly a must stop on any Tourist tour, this mansion is absolutely amazing and I encourage all to support it by becoming a Vizcayan.,Originally designed as a get away party home the Halloween Sundowner is one of the main three fundraisers for this place. It also is one of the few occasions to see it at night. ,During the day, the building, the gardens and the view of Biscayne bay are great, but at night, the subtle lighting through out the building and the gardens make this a truly amazing sight.,...add to this a few hundred people dressed in the spirit of Halloween and some great music...and you have the best party in town.,Also look for the july4th and New Years bash."
"I know I'm gonna get my butt kicked for this one...but its a baseball stadium, big deal. Unless you like baseball its is actually really frustrating because all the bars get packed with screaming obnoxious fans for half the year, making it really hard to enjoy the area on a game night, let alone to even walk through brookline ave."
"Beautiful place on the waterfront, especially the gardens."
5 Star museum and gardens that every Floridian should visit once. I enjoyed the gardens more than the house and could spend all day there.
"A little oasis in Miami, especially if you like a little history and gardens. I loved the gardens which are formal Italian in style with many cascades, statues, clipped hedges. The location is right on the water with pleasant Venetian style walkways along the edge and an almost ostentatious stone dock in the shape of a galleon to view. A great place to spend a few hours!"
"I was very disappointed to see that the park service was not maintaining this beautiful, important memorial.  There were large patches of black mold on the marble which destroys it.  The marble hadn't been cleaned in a long time.,In addition all the parking had been permanently blocked off even for handicapped.  You had to be lucky enough to find a parking place on the street and walk in."
"Historic? Check. Overpriced but delicious snack food? Check. Home of the Red Sox?Yup. Except for that Fenway is an over hyped concrete hall thats been dressed up nicely but is still an over the hill ball park which has become historic by virtue of not being torn down/renovated. Go for the history, stay for the legions of like minded Sox fans but if you want comfort, decent sight lines, or a family atmosphere ... stay home."
"$15.00 ,Many homes that have been turned over due to high costs for upkeep. A National historic landmark now.  I think they made a mistake with choosing this one.  Sure there were tapestries, antiquities, but none were impressive. ,This estate was dark and gloomy.  Musty spell.  All the bedrooms were pretty much the same after you viewed a couple.  And there were two bedrooms three flights up.  Walk up and then - is this what I climbed up the spiral stairs to see?  And the gardens?  Due to a subtropical storm in the morning, the gardens were like a wading pool in the afternoon. What I did see from upstairs looking out the window was o.k. Not great. ,Eliminate from your bucket list of things to see and do in Miami."
Sight seeing only. I think Filoli in Half Moon Bay is better.
I heard of this place when I was visiting and I decided to check it out and it's honestly a BEAUTIFUL PLACE!!! If you love history! And taking lots of  pictures!! It's mostly European with some Asian influence loved it
"You've got to do this while you are in Miami.  It's absolutely stunning, and some of the coolest collection of random antiques that I've ever seen.,It kind of reminds me of a wannabe Versailles, but in a cool way!"
"There are many many memorials in DC, this is one of the one that I think one should not miss.  During the cherry blossom season, along the water, it is a favorite wedding picture spot.  During the winter, it can be cold and windy.  None the less, it is impressive.  My pic says it all.  Look for the pic here."
"Came to D.C in April, and it was very chilly. Despite the cold, the purpose of this trip was to see the cherry blossoms. I don't know much about history, but my goal was to visit all of the memorials & monuments. This review will not be helpful, but it will be for my own future reference.,My boyfriend and I were pooped from walking around, we saw the Jefferson Memorial from afar, however decided to take a taxi to go eat. We were not able to get a close view."
"Way cooler than the Lincoln memorial, if you ask me.  If the presidents had a popularity contest, I'd hope that Jefferson would win.  Unfortunately I'm afraid that his memorial wins no popularity contests, because there are very few tourists here when I come."
"Oh, it's ok.  You should go once if you haven't, I guess.  Nice views on a clear day, but ridiculously expensive."
"I went here on a trip with my son because he wanted to see the needle thing in Seattle.  It was a cute idea and I was happy to oblige him as my father had done for me once too.  I agree with others, this is really a do it once kind of thing.  We got lucky and had a gorgeous day in Seattle, 65 degrees and mostly sunny.  It is a beautiful view from up top.  Snow capped mountains all around, a beautiful bay and the city below.  Watch the people, enjoy the view and just take it in."
A really nice staple of the city. You can't NOT go to the space needle if you are visiting Seattle. It is a beautiful 360-degree view of downtown and the harbor and a fun elevator ride. I strongly recommend getting the day/night pass.
"Y'know what?  I don't like heights.  And I REALLY don't like watching the elevator operator lean against the glass doors while riding up into the sky.  Futhermore, I have to question if going at night was really going to give us the best visual.,And it was darned stupid of me to pay through the nose for that experience.  ,But hey -- you don't have to pay to visit the giant gift shop at the bottom.  You just feel like a fraud taking home Space Needle gifts when you didn't actually go up."
"So worth the wait and the money!,If you're visiting Seattle, definitely check it out."
"A must for your first visit to Seattle.  Excellent view and lots of historical stories surrounding the Space Needle and various sub-stories.  Great wine and appetizers from the observation deck.  The gentleman (Arthur) who was running this food and drink station was AWESOME!  Very friendly, very helpful and very informative.  Arthur defintely made everyone feel welcome!"
Great view of the city!
"It's the Space Needle!,I go every time I'm in Seattle & I always enjoy going up the elevator and walking out on the open deck with those spectacular views!,If it's a nice day the view of the city & Mt Rainier is simply spectacular!,I once watched the Blue Angels perform from the Space Needle & it was THE ONLY WAY to see an air show!,The Space Needle is Seattle, you gotta love it!"
"i think the space needle is beautiful and i love driving by/walking by in the middle of the night while it's lighted up.,as for the ride up the space needle, it's a bit pricey so i can't remember the last time i went up but -- i love the structure itself!"
Not a fan of the space needle but loved the architecture of the buildings surrounding it.  Also enjoyed the walk through the park.  A great deal of activity going on here so a must see for the entire family.
"Views - 5 stars. Service and organization including wait time - 1 star. Average the rating however you like depending on your priority of each. Went in July so definitely busy tourist time. However, got In the -kiosk only -line at 715. Got a ticket around 745 for 9pm ""launch"" but ticket says boarding starts 830. Had a quick bite, rushed back at 830 and got in line labelled 9p boarding. Did not go up the needle until 930-945. The most irritating thing was that other people who were in the 9 or even 930 group got in the other line labelled 830 and went right up by 9. When a few of us politely asked about why that was, the guide said that the lines were mixed. He didn't even look at our ticket times. Tip: get in the shortest line no matter whatever the time or your ticket says. I have to say though, the views were spectacular once up there. 930 was a great time to be there if you can time it (in july) because we saw the beautiful colors just after the sunset and you only had to wait 20 minutes to see the night views, also beautiful."
"WOW!  Blown away.  If I was given the chance to travel back in time for just one day, I honestly think I'd spend my day here.  Is that random?  Maybe but that's all I kept thinking of when I was here.  Seriously, this was 1920's unimaginable opulence and I can't even fathom what it'd be like to attend a party here.  I'm not even going to try to adequately describe just how enchanted I was with this place.  It's no wonder in the half hour or so I spent just touring the gardens, I saw at least 3 brides and a few other people getting professional portraits done.  I can't blame them, if I lived in Miami, I'd definitely do the same.,TIP:  I highly suggest doing the audio tour.  It's only $5 extra and gives you so much great info.  Otherwise, you're stuck with the little info they provide at the designated spots, which really isn't much.  Trust me, you'll get so much more out of your trip here if you do the audio tour.,Bonus TIP:  If you take the free trolley, it'll drop you off directly in front of the entrance."
"The view here is magnificent its a must see for tourist. The emblem of our city. you won't be disappoint onces you get on, the elevator is stomach turning. It is a hassle to find parking or you just don't want to pay but the bus is always a option just make sure you go on a hot sunny day makes it worthwhile ."
"The Space Needle is one of those things that feels incredibly much like something that a tourist would do...and, being a tourist, I gave myself a pass just this once.  It's about the same as being at the top of a really tall building in whatever city you're in, only you get the skyline of Seattle.  (Only without the iconic Space Needle, which is a little ironic).  Yes, it was cool.  No, it probably wasn't worth the cost of the ticket (which I think is steep at $19 a pop).  I do love that they're open late, so you can go up after dinner with your date and saunter around the top of it.  It's cool that they take your picture, let you pick out a campy background, and email it to you for free.  It's also great that there are tables and a cafe in the observation deck so that you can hang out a little longer.  And, I'm not sure if this was a normal experience, but when we went around 10 pm on a Monday, the place was nearly deserted.  Loved the Chihuly exhibit that is going on right now, so make sure to get a combined ticket and save yourself $5."
"A bit too pricey for a nice view that gets old after 10-15 minutes. I can also be very cold if you are up there anytime but the summer. It's a great place to take the tourists/family from out of town. I enjoyed the experience when I first moved here and it was new, but now would only go to take family that comes in from out of town.,Nice to do once or twice...not much more."
"Everything was super fast, and employees were very nice and polite. I recommend that you print the forms before getting there so that way will be even faster. Bring any single document you think you might need ( original)."
Lovely gem. Well worth the visit.
"I'm a die hard Cub fan.  I will be 'till the day that I die.  That being said, this is the best MLB park that I've been into!  I love it here!  The fans, the ambiance, everything about this park rocks!  I have to say that the (Red, not White!)Sox have always been my AL team, so, this review is a little bias, however, nothing comes close to being as awesome as Fenway!  Wrigley is a close second, but come on, how do you compare to the Green Monster!?"
"Photography is not allowed inside, which was a bummer.  I noticed a few impressive wedding books that were available to view which pitched Vizcaya's beautiful, lush grounds for your romantic events.  =)   As a tourist, it was one of the few Miami attractions, away from the bustle of South Beach that I really appreciated."
"Really enjoyed our visit to Vizcaya.  A really beautiful, fascinating and unique attraction.,The house is really beautiful and full of interesting artifacts, and it's pretty much the closest thing you'll get to a real old European villa in the states.  But it has some really unique charm of its own that comes from the way the place was assembled.  And it really was assembled - not only does it have paintings, tapestries, and other artifacts from renaissance Europe (and some other eras), but some of the building itself is literally ripped wholesale from much older European buildings - doors, windows, fireplaces, and even ceilings and walls.  ,I keep saying ""European"" because even though the exterior was to based on an Italian villa, there are rooms representative of several different countries and eras from Southern Europe.  ,It's also a very interesting viewpoint into the time and the life of James Deering.  He must have been quite a personality to assemble this place (not to mention quite the bank account).  And it's really neat how the house, despite all the old artifacts, was a pretty early example of a house wired with electricity.  For example, the house has centuries-old candelabras adapted for lightbulbs - and there were also plenty of thing like a neat old fridge and electric dumbwaiter.  ,Plus you can't beat the setting - right on the ocean, with a neat stone boat as a breakwater.,The gardens themselves were nice, too, although nothing spectacular.  They had a nice orchid garden, and it was enjoyable to walk around the gardens on a beautiful day.  Still, if you're expecting Versailles west you're going to be disappointed.,We went on a tour, which I definitely recommend.  It was a great way to get the story of the man and the house, and to get some little tidbits about the house itself (for instance, like how some of the original dishes intended for the kitchen were lost on the Titanic).  ,There were at least three girls doing their quinceanera photoshoots in the garden, which was pretty amusing as well as indicative of the appeal of the place.,We had a great visit and I'm definitely glad we went.  It's a really neat, unique place and definitely worth a visit!"
"I probably have the least to say about this monument, but Jefferson was a great intellectual and this memorial is grand but falls short on somehow conveying how much he influenced this country's legal system.,A beautiful structure, no doubt. You should definitely visit it."
"It really is impossible not to love Fenway. The surroundings of the park on game day are like no other place. It turns into its own little village with closed off streets and street vendors with great smells of sausages all around. People just mill about and it is a great scene. The park is very easy to navigate which is nice as well. There are never long, long lines to wait in or long trails to walk to, to get to your seat. I'm sure if I was 280 lbs., I wouldn't like the seats and they are nothing to write home about, that is for sure, especially compared to modern stadiums. But it is a great place to watch a game, and the right field bleachers might be the best place possible when weighing price as a factor. Really, this is more of a landmark than just a baseball stadium."
"Stunning!,The Vizcaya Museum & Gardens are a must see if you are visiting Miami, FL. The house is phenomenal and its owner (James Deering) really knew how to live, creating a magnificent Renaissance Mediterranean style villa with all the modern amenities of the time: electricity, indoor plumbing, elevators, and phone lines. Though, these things are such a part of the villa (a palazzo, really), that you don't notice them and you think you're in some Florentine prince's home. Every room is an artistic masterpiece and even the main kitchen is a marvel of modernity.,Not only did Mr. Deering have taste in art and antiquity, but he also had a talent for picking people to work with him:  Paul Chalfin (Designer & Interior Decorator), Diego Suarez (Landscape Designer) and F Burrall Hoffman (Architect) . Each of these gentlemen were responsible for the surrounding beauty and working harmony of the place overall - inside and out.,My family and I spent a couple of hours at the place and counted no less than ten sweet sixteen photo shoots happening around the grounds - even saw a couple of brides.,The State has made some upgrades, but these are tasteful and unobtrusive to the original structures and surroundings. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to take pictures inside the Villa but can take as many as you want outside."
"Absolutely beautiful!  I love that it was self guided, so you could take as much or as little time to tour the house and the gardens as you wanted.  Everything about this place was top notch - beautiful furnishings, immaculate gardens, and a great gift shop too!"
Admission is $18. Free parking but small lot. We had to park across the street at the museum. There's a pedestrian nature trail which is really shaded by the trees. This was very helpful in the heat! The mansion is beautiful with a courtyard in the middle. The back of the house faces the Biscayne and even has a barge. The gardens are expansive and beautiful. We didn't even see all of the gardens because we got really tired. It took us 1.5 hours to tour the house and half of the gardens. The house is an interesting juxtaposition of different time periods and the original owner a bit of a mystery. I loved reading the tidbits and exploring the estate.
Water front. Beautiful. Grandiose. Must see. Picturesque. 4 quotes- paragraph style are shared on the walls. With Jefferson taking center stage.
"As a DC tour guide, I have been to all of the Memorial numerous times, but this is one of those that never ceases to amaze!  Its best to come here at dusk so you can see the sun setting and lights turning on.,Jefferson was our 1st Secretary of State, 2nd Vice President, and 3rd President in addition to being the primary author of the Declaration of Independence.  The memorial was designed to be reminiscent of Monticello and the University of Virginia, both of which Jefferson designed.  Around the top is the quote, 'I have sworn upon the alter of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man,' which I used as a talking point with my students.  ,I also asked them to find 5 things hidden in his cloak,*Eagle representing patriotism,*A book representing scholarly pursuits,*An ear of corn representing agriculture,*Tobacco leaves representing industry,*and a tree representing nature,I also asked my students to tell me what Jefferson is looking at (the White House - it is said that this was done so that he could keep his eye on the current president)!"
"If you've been here during the day and love it, you've GOT to check it out in the evening. That's true with most DC memorials (omg, WW2...!!). It can also be really romantic - a friend of mine proposed to his girlfriend here and made a ""declaration"" of his own! So when the weather gets better, be sure to check out this spot after the sun's gone down."
Pricey but well worth it.
"The iconic landmark of the Emerald City :D I love it! What a great place to bring friends and family from out of town. It is pricey to get up there though, but with the Seattle City Pass ($69) you can go up there 2 times on consecutive days and you have access to 5 other attractions as well :). Or you could always just go up to the restaurant that is in the Space Needle (their weekend brunch is delicious!) and get a free ride up the Needle and into their restaurant. Then you could walk on the observation deck for free after your meal :D. Now, they will also take your picture as well in front of a blue screen and you can change the backgrounds when your on the observation desks at one of the kiosks. Of course they want you to pay for the picture, but you can email yourself 1 picture for free :D But just to take a single trip up here it is pretty expensive.....but they do have a Starbucks up there if you want some coffee :),Pros:,- Great views of the rest of the city,- Great deal if you get the City Pass and you can come up here 2 days in a row,- restaurant is mighty delicious even though it is expensive.....that's why you have to come for the weekend brunch for a 3 course meal (~35$),Cons:,- with great views of the city, it's really nice BUT you can't see the most iconic building of the city.....because you're in it,- tourist trap......but uf course it is!,Why I gave it a 4.....,I've been here plenty of times with family friends and it always excites me every time :) The trip up the Needle is pretty expensive, but you have to try it at least once. There is a Starbucks up at the top which is nice :) Any time I have an out of town guest, I always bring them here and I don't mind taking the trip again either :)"
"$20+ dollars to see the views of Seattle-I'll pass. My friend actually took me to a place in Seattle where the view was better but I will  need to ask her the name of the place. I think this place is a tourist trap. If you really want a picture, just stand next to it and pretend you were there."
"This is a complete robbery! $20 a person to go up the elevator, theres not even discounted rates for groups or residents. And once you get up there they charge you up the !@#!@ on souvenirs. I'd rather take my out of state friends and family on a drive on the viaduct and let them shop at pike place for cheaper souvenirs and eat on the waterfront for less money and a better time"
"We took the monorail (built in 1962) to the needle from Westlake Center next to Nordstrom.  It was $4 round trip.  It's beats walking and it was really quick.  The needle itself is really expensive if you're not eating at Sky City.  At least the binoculars are free and not quarters.  The views are obstructed by metal wiring (Sky City Restaurant views are not obstructed).  It's supercrowded with tourists, especially wild children running around chaotically from their parents. Definitely a must-do once for tourists."
"A must see if you go to seattle. It's a little pricey to go to at $19/adult, but if you have never been, its worth going at least once. Make sure to bring a jacket when you go up, it can get pretty cold/windy up there. The view is amazing though, both during the day and at night. I recommend getting the $33/adult combo package with the glass and garden museum. That museum is gorgeous!"
"Something fun to do when you have visitors in town. I picked up an annual pass a few months ago when it was on sale (apparently it happens once a year, as annoying as it is, sign up for the space needle newsletter- the sale usually happens around March) for ONLY $30. For a full year, every day, I can go up to the top with a +1. It's a sweet deal, it pays for itself with one trip. Oh, and you always get to skip the line and go to will call. It's a great deal.,The view is nice, especially when it's a clear view of the mountains. The wine at the top is a bit over priced, but that's to be expected, yes? ,Something everyone should visit, hey, if you're nice, I might bring you up on my pass. (:"
"Visiting the observation deck at the Space Needle is a bit of an expensive activity, but really, can you visit Seatlle without having gone up the Space Needle?  That's like going to San Francisco and not seeing the Golden Gate, or visiting New York City without a trip up the Empire State Building.  Needless to say, we did spend one magical evening up there on the observatory when the sun was setting, the skies were clear, a light breeze was blowing, and you could watch the ferries go to and fro in the water.  The views are spectacular and you just get a little jealous at all the lucky Seattlites who get to live in such beauty.  ,-1 star for selling some totally crappy coffee in the gift store on the ground floor.  I know I should have just picked up coffee beans from a specialty store, but I ran out of time, and instead, embarassed myself and all of Seattle's coffee culture by giving this god-awful coffee as a gift.  Words cannot describe just how god-awful it was...."
"Great destination and amazing views when the weather's right (we went right after it rained and then cleared up) but felt a bit ripped off at $18/person. One less item on my bucket list, I guess."
yea its high up but i don't think its worth the price of admission ($17).  i would only go if you have the seattle pass
A very fun place to go!!
"I had to visit the Space Needle when I was in Seattle. The $16 was definitely pricey, but you only live once right? Even though I went on a cloudy day, the view was amazing. I'm not dying to go again, but I think it's an experience everyone should try at least once."
"Good view and all...but its starting to look dated.  Expensive to go up.  But if it's your first time to Seattle, it is a ""must-go"".  So go.  Then go elsewhere."
"Awe. This place left me in awe. ,Really, how have I lived in Miami for six years and never visited ""Miami's Only Public National Historic Landmark""? From the Versailles-like gardens to the beautiful main house with countless rooms to explore, I was transported out of Miami and back to Europe.,Here's a neat fact about me: I love open houses. Going from room to room, not sure what's behind the next corner or up the following staircase, it's such a fun game that truly makes me giddy. We didn't opt to do the audio tour, but instead, explored on our own, reading the informational plaques along the way. ,After marveling at the detail of everything from the ceilings and art pieces to the furniture and views (ok, I marveled A LOT at that beautiful kitchen), we made our way outside to see the beautiful orchids, seashell-adorned pool and, of course, the main gardens which were ripe for exploring! I could get lost in them and truly just relax and find some peace for a few hours. ,I can't forget to mention the breathtaking view from the terrace overlooking Biscayne Bay. Standing there really warrants a deep breath to really take in how wonderful it is to live in The Magic City. ,I want to get married here, I want to do a photoshoot here, I want to go to an event here, basically, I just want to BE here (live here?) every single day."
come in the evening
We decided to do get the day and night ticket (see it during the day and come back again within 24 hours) and had a great time both times.  I agree with the reviews about the high cost of the tickets...the City Pass makes sense if you intend to go to the rest of the places City Pass includes.  The free pictures you get at the end was cool given that you have to pay at many places.
"I had to do the tourist thing and check out the Space Needle. I took the monorail from downtown, it was a very short ride over. I checked out the gift shop and the little stores and sites on the ground, but never made it up to the Space Needle itself. I'm sure it would have been beautiful, but the admission price to see what I've probably already seen didn't seem worth it to me. There's still plenty to see from the ground, so all was not lost."
this isnt a card center if you need a new ss card your in the wrong building but the officer at the door was so nice and kind lol...i didnt get pass him so i cant say more. Parking is a bit of a problem.
WOW! We had an awesome experience at this museum. Beautiful place & the gardens was amazing. We will definitely be back!
I only needed to go to one game at Fenway to make me a Red Sox fan for life.  The excitment is contagious!
"Took a red eye plane to Beantown on a late Saturday for a Sunday afternoon game vs. Baltimore.  Took the light rail to the game and when we get there, it is a street festival with merchandisers,  food vendors, street performers and the fans; I was just soaking it all up.   Being hungry, I decided to try a Steak Tip sandwich at one of the vendor's grills.  Man was it good.  It was steak marinated with wonderful flavor served on a (slightly crunchy outside, soft and melt in your mouth chewy inside) roll with sliced red, green and yellow peppers and onions.   Being one of only three stadiums left from the era before the modern concrete, it was awesome to see the exterior kept up to its historic look with the name of the park etched in stone.  ,Now, when we got inside, the first thing we did was walk over to the seating area and touched the big green monster; what a rush!!!,The seating was a little cramped, but to be sitting in the old fashioned wooden seats, with beams in the way was an experience that must be tried by all baseball fans.  The great part is that you are so close to the action that you can hear the crack of every bat that hits a ball.  The Green Monster seats that were added is a great way to add seating capacity without compromising the look of the park.,They also play ""Sweet Caroline"" by Brooklyn, NY native Neil Diamond to which the fans sing along with.  I forgot to ask how long that tradition has been happening.  Anyway, after the game, my best friend purchased two stickers; one said, ""Yankees Suck"" and the other ""Damon Sold Out"".  After the game, walked the streets of Boston and went to the Bull and Finch, best known as Cheer's."
I have been going to this place since I was 10 and I still enjoy it and I am 30. I would recommend it to anyone. The mansion is spectacular and the views are amazing.
"What a house!!! The decoration, view, everything is worth the visit!!!  The garden OMG Amazing!  If you come to Miami you have to go to Vizcaya, don't miss it!"
"I was sad I missed the cherry blossoms when I came mid-April! Luckily, it wasn't super humid yet so visiting Jefferson Memorial was rather enjoyable. The pictures taken at sunset look a lot more attractive than at the height of noon. It's not my favorite memorial in DC, but it's a must-visit if you are in DC and on a memorial-visiting spree."
"This park is old.  The only real difference between Fenway and a defunct subway tunnel is the smell of urine.  A beer will cost you just under $10- and once you break the seal there's always a line and a pool of unidentifiable liquid on the floor of the bathroom.  ,As for the hot dogs- they sell them in the supermarket for those of you who are unaware of this phenomenon.  The cost of one frank at Fenway will buy you about two dozen at the Star Market down the street.  You can elect what sketchy water to boil them in.  ,The seats are incredibly  narrow- think preschool desk- and can easily cost you about a day's worth of work.  That is, if you can even come by tickets.  Even this, unfortunately, doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to see a damn thing.  ,If you like beer spilled on you by militant fans who will criticize every play of the game then you will be in your element here.  Get over the hype of the park and watch the game in a bar.  At least there they have seating meant to accommodate an adult-sized ass."
Its a unique piece of architecture in Miami.  Considering that Miami is a new city compared to the old world this is a nice place.  Worth the visit but you wont be impressed if you have been to the real and original (as opposed to copies) palaces and gardens of the old world ie. Versailles Palace in France.
"Loved this place. I came into miami for a long weekend and spent most of my saturday here. This is definitely a place for people that appreciate museums or more cultural activities. A nice break from some of the party miami hot spots. The entire property is picture worthy and we saw quite a few wedding and quincenera photo shoots. ,Bring your student id if you're on a student budget and appreciate the discount! ;)"
"I love museums and this I found to be very interesting. My family is from Louisiana and I read a letter that was written by James Deering he was writing about his friend whom was the owner of the Tabasco plant in Avery Islands, Louisiana! I was thrilled to see how small of a world it is even back then. The gardens were nice but what I truly loved about this place was how ahead of his time Mr. Deering was in his home. I would recommend the audio tour if you traveled alone like myself."
"Visited the Jefferson Memorial during the Cherry Blossom Festival (early April) and it was crowded with visitors during the daytime.  Currently have constructions going on, so you have to enter by the road.,Have 2 gift stores located on the ground level.,Great spot of taking pictures at night when there are less people."
"This is a great place to visit, it's a bit far from the national mall so if you're tired from walking, I would go rent out a City Bike or jump on those site to site tour bus.   ,The memorial itself is fairly grand, there's a bit of renovation but that didn't hinder my view to the rest of the DC area including a scenic shot of the Washington memorial"
"Sure it's out of the way, but I still think it is worth visiting.  The walk isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, so tighten those laces and check it out.  There are some great views and the crowds are lighter than the other memorials, so you can actually spend some time to read the words and appreciate it."
"The Space Needle is just about the most famous landmark in Seattle.  I give it three stars just for that.  You have to kind of go there to be like, ""Oh, I've been to the Space Needle."",Why didn't I give it five stars?  It's really not that high or impressive.  Stratosphere in Las Vegas is higher.  I've been to NY...so the Space Needle is a dwarf in my book.,Would I come here again?  No, but I am glad I came here once just to see it and experience it."
"$18 to get to the top, but once you're up there, there ain't much to do. But I enjoyed it because I'm a sucker for views. Thankfully it was a nice day in Seattle and you could actually see things. I loved being on the outside deck, yet my partner was scared so he stayed inside. The views are amazing. You can see the water, the city, the mountains and the beautiful clouds.,I like that they take your picture (for free) and let you email it to yourself at no charge! Such a nice little souvenir! ,We went on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded at all. No line to get up or down. They do serve food, coffee/tea and beer/wine up top but it's a little overpriced."
"Iconic Seattle tourist destination. Expensive ($20 for the elevator ride). So much fun, though. Amazing views, amazing piece of Seattle history. Great place to hang out and take pictures. Everyone needs to visit at least once. Great place for kids or to take a date. ,Not much to it that isn't obvious, unless you didn't know there's a restaurant up there. It's pretty much a line, an elevator ride, and then checking out the view. Very safe up there, though not pleasant for acrophobics (as I have grown to be).,Fair wanring on the restaurant...all you really get for your money is a table with a view. The food is pretty much banquet fare. If you have any sensitivity to poor value or mediocre food, you'll be disappointed. But you rotate almost 360 degrees while you dine, getting a great eyeful of the entire city. In certain company, you might be a stick in the mud if you suggest dining elsewhere."
"I have to admit that when I paid my visit to the the Space Needle, I (not literally) ran up, did a lap around the top, and then ran down. Well, as fast as the lines would let me anyway.,First off, I'm not a huge fan of heights. So naturally I don't want to spend my time at the top of a top-heavy building. Second of all, the line to buy the tickets/get on the elevator/and then the elevator line to go back down was torturous. Also, $16... yeah. $16. What. A. Rip. But I paid, like every other good tourist does just to check it off the list in life and then I was out of there. ,Worth it? Mehh... no."
"So, this is one of those places that you basically have to do.  ,At least once.,On a nice night, the view from the top is pretty neat.  Especially if you like photography.  ,Tips:,- Wear warm clothes - it's windy up top,- Go at night - the skyline is beautiful,- Don't go if it's not a clear night."
"Space Needle is fine.  Great view, food is good (but expensive), and it's always nice to say you've been there.  I'm writing this review to warn visitors of the scam that's going on in the parking lot across from the needle.  This is the triangular lot at the corner of Broad and 4th. There's a booth on the Broad entrance, so it makes you think there's an attendant at the lot. My son and I pulled in the lot the morning of our visit and as soon as we pulled into a space, someone walks up to my window and says $10 please.  Well, turns out he's not with the parking lot company.  Hands you a fake ticket then walks away like he's supposed to be there.  It's a very good scam, because the setup is exactly what you would think would happen, so you pay him and don't think twice about it.  The reality is the lot sign (in very small letters, and you're excited to get to the needle and not reading all the signs at that point...iow, you just want to pay and move on to the needle) says there isn't an attendant and to pay at the payment box.  What's odd and very suspicious is the timestamp on the ticket they put on my rental car was only 10 minutes after I parked.  They don't have an attendant taking money, but the parking lot company has some undercover employee watching for 'non-payers' and handing out tickets complete with a picture of your plate and a timestamp.  My rental car company paid the claim (as they were the ones presented with the claim) and told me that if I didn't absorb the $95 penalty, that collection agencies and lawyers would be getting involved.  You think that through for 5 seconds and decide to pay the fine...then move on with your life.  Frankly, I think the citizens of Seattle and the City of Seattle should be ashamed to let this scam go on.  The parking lot company loves it because they get to bill more 'fees.'  The rental car company doesn't complain, because they add their 'fee' on top of the parking lot company fees.  They're all letting it happen, knowing that the visitor is now gone and they have them by the cojones (yes, cojones).  Just accept this post as your heads-up to avoid a very expensive parking space."
"Amazing views of Seattle!  They have interactive screens throughout inside of the observation deck like a camera you can use to zoom into a particular area of Seattle and an informational screen where you can learn about different Seattle attractions.,My boyfriend and I got the Seattle CityPass and the Space Needle was one of the attractions that was included.  You are also granted 2 tickets for the Space Needle with the CityPass so that was plus because you can visit once during the day and once at night."
"Anyone who visits the Space Needle must be an idiot to begin with.,It's like going to Paris to visit Disneyland."
"The structure of this tower is magnificent, but I don't know if it's really worth that much just to go up there. Last time I went up there it was foggy and couldn't see much of anything. But I thought, why not? I think whatever activities happening underneath are much better. Especially during summer."
"nice views of the city, couldn't see mount rainier"
"Incredible 360 view of the Seattle area. Definitely a tourist trap, but it's worth the view. For $18 per person you can see the observation deck, a total rip off if you ask me. I suggest dining at SkyCity and getting ""free admission"" with a better view. We opted to go to dine at the SkyCity (with a $25 , gift certificate) and we had  wayyy better view here than the deck itself. Much less people to fight to see the view, you get your own little view and dinner, rather than paying $18 per person just for having a work your way through tourists to get a picture or a good view. I highly recommend it rather than just paying admission. See my review for SkyCity restaurant."
"Much respect to the Management/Ownership of the Space Needle for allowing MTV to shoot their series premier of ""The Phone"". I love when the nation gets to see the Space Needle, especially during televised sporting events, but to have a contestant running around the actual dish, OUTSIDE of the observation deck, grabbing flags to try and win the challenge, that was heart-stopping action at its best!"
"We have been staying in Florida for years we drove from fort  Lauderdale and it was a simple drive , easy to find too. My 8 year old son and I really were amazed with the beauty of this site. We spent about 2 hours at the end of the day and then went to coconut grove which is a 10 minute drive from here. I highly recommend. It is a must see site."
"You have to visit here, whether you're a hater or not. It's the Space Needle and everyone around the world knows either what it is or where it's at. It really does have spectacular views. I take A LOT of pictures, and predominately all of them are great, but the 3 best pictures I have ever taken have come from the top of the needle. A view of Mt. Rainier, a sunset, and a ferris wheel. They were spectacular. Of course, you're going to be disatisfied on a cloudy, rainy day because your views are taken away, but if you can take advantage of a clear, sunny day, head on over to the needle. It offers breathtaking views, especially if you love mountains. Yes, the price is a bit steep and it is definitely always packed full of visitors, but don't let that deter you from having a good time."
"Everybody needs to go to the space needle and eat at SkyCity at least once if they live in or are visiting Seattle.  SkyCity still has a very 50's kitch feel to it.,My wife and I were able to get a window seat.  We got lucky with the view, it had rained earlier in the day but cleared up by the time we sat down.  The sky was crystal clear and the city looked amazing.  ,Since neither of us has grown up much we put a penny on the rail, just because.  When we got back around to the spot somebody had replaced our penny with a dime.  Not to be outdone we added another dime and a nickle.  A little further along we found a note from a couple that were visiting from Finland.  We wrote a little message back to them and placed the note back on the rail.  I imagine this type of thing goes on all the time, it was a fun little game for the adults to play though.  ,The restaurant rotates slowly but I still found myself a little light headed.  The strong drink the bartender poured me didn't help things either.  People with vertigo may not last long here.,The food was better than I expected.  I had the prime rib special and my wife had the halibut.  The halibut was super fresh and excellent, the potatoes that came with it were superb.  ,The prime rib was very good and perfectly medium-rare just as ordered.  The asparagus was drenched in butter and the mashed potatoes were creamy but not over whipped.,We ordered the tiramasu and the Lunar Orbiter for desert.  Neither of us have had the Lunar Orbiter before and honestly didn't know what to expect.  It was a fun treat though and added a ton of points to the kitsch factor.  Before hand we asked our waiter for a free desert (I have no shame) and he pulled through for us.  So give it a shot, you might get lucky.  ,Overall it was a great night.  If you subtract the normal cost of riding to the top of the needle from the price of dinner then it is reasonably priced.  If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night make sure to reserve a table well in advance.  The rest of the week though you should be able to just walk right up and get a table.  Also make sure to take your time and enjoy the view.  Bring a camera and don't be afraid to have fun and act a little bit like a child."
The cost is ridiculous!  We decided this was not something we wanted to spend our hard earned money on.  We saw a beautiful view on the boat to Bainbridge Island ferry for $7.50 RT.
"Im with all the other 5 starers. The best bureaucratic office I've been obliged to go to, in the world, and I've been to a few. The staff are super friendly and efficient,  and in the several times I've been I've hardly waited more than 10 mins  to be served. ,Funny story. The first time I went in I forgot to turn off my cell and as I'm just about to be served at the counter, my cell rings loudly with my silly ringtone and it's then I notice all the signs warning to turn off your cell. The women behind the glass snapped, ""is that your cellphone?"" I thought that was it. Back to the end of the line. Instead she asked me what ringtone it was and then changed her ringtone to it! Other staff heard her changing hers and came out and did the same thing. Instead of being told off we all had a good laugh. ,Why can't more offices be like this one?"
Does Fenway really need to be explained?
"This is the classiest place you'll find in South Florida.  Whereas so much of Miami feels deliberately tawdry, Vizcaya will transport you to a completely different world.  It is a beautiful building and gardens to match.  ,There is so much to discover both inside and outside that I could have easily spent the entire day just wandering about.  As others have noted, you are bound to run into a Quinceanera or three during your visit, but the grounds are big enough that you won't have any problem finding a nice quiet spot to yourself.,This is the perfect place to take my parents when they visit.  I will definitely be back."
"One complaint my wife and I have of Miami is the general lack of interesting places to see beautiful art and architecture.  Vizcaya is definitely a gem in this city.  I hadn't been since I was a kid, so it felt like an all new experience.  My wife had never been.  As an interior design student, it was obviously an unbelievable experience.  ,Our recommendation is take your camera and go nuts with the pics.  We got some shots that can easily go in a photo coffee table book.  You're not supposed to take pics inside but if you don't use flash and watch out for the guards you can take pics of all the rooms in the house (the courtyard is more difficult)."
"I was here on a gloomy day. The sky was mostly grey, although the blue and the sun peeked out towards the end of my time here. It had rained earlier, and it was getting ready to rain again.,That being said, even on a grey, rainy, Florida afternoon, Vizcaya is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.,I think I'm going to propose to my girlfriend here one day."
"Hard to get to, but this is a fantastic monument.  You can park across the basin and walk around to it (probably your best bet).  Its a gorgeous walk on a nice day."
"I have been to hundreds of games at Fenway.......This is my POV on the best seating at the ""PAAAKKKKK"",Yes, I will share what I have spent hundreds of dollars just to realize...........Um, er, my boyfriend has spent...j/k...well not really......lol,BEST seats are on the Budweiser Roof deck. You have your own bathrooms, your own bar and if you pay extra for tables, your own waitress. The view ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get there early as if you are standing room only, you can only lean up against a counter and only the first ""row"" of people are able to utilize it.  Everyone else just stands behind them. It SUCKS if you are short and are behind a TALL person.......Note....if you see a group of people leave early and they were sitting at a table in front of SRO,  grab them and ask for their ticket stub..They don't care and you can enjoy the rest of the game at their table! ,If at ALL possible, don't eat here or at least know you will pay $10 for a HAMBURGER....if you don't mind that....than go ahead because it aint half bad :) Now the only problem I had on the Bud Roof Deck......was the BITCHY bartenders ...... They ignored me and were like bees on honey to the cute guys ordering a zillion beers.........There is a TWO beer limit in the rest of the park........they just let them order what they wanted......Also they close the bar down earlier than everywhere else in the park and even if you have been standing there for 20 minutes while these old women were salvitating over all the men,  the computers are down and they will NOT budge....I gave my best hissy fit-trust me,Next. If you are tall.......try to get aisle seats.....also, each section is different....some seating has numbered seating closer to the field, some has lettered seating closer to the field......sometimes you can get a deal on two seats that has are in different section but are still next to each other...only to be separated by a railway.......who cares unless you are planning on having a MAJOR PDA fest...I don't......also, if you get tickets that are piggybacked you will save big time....people are usually accomodating...if not who cares if you just have to turn around to see your friend...I don't,I would check ebay. They have the best deals.........You will still pay a pretty penny for Yanks or ideal seating but it is less expensive than stub hub or a ticket agency. We get all of our tickets for the games here. Read auction carefully for disclaimers!!!!!!!,Also, check out ,go to baseball, than fenway for a helpful diagram ,Oh yeah...the people who come around and take your pic.....I think it is a cute idea, but a rip off........bring your own camera.........I have ordered it a few times, but they suck at taking the pics and it just isn't worth the money"
"I saw the reviews before going to Vizcaya and I did not leave disappointed. , The most stunning is the grounds and garden work.  The views on the Ocean are spectacular and you can really imagine the luxurious living that was taking place.  When entering it was like entering a magic garden, people were happy, taking pictures and there were even photo shoots going on! ,Inside the house is OPEN concept and worth the tour as well!  When at Vizcaya you are in a Mediterranean renaissance and do not want to leave, you enjoy the serenity and beauty it has to offer!"
"am a Miamian and I remember going to Vizcaya in grammar school and thinking, ""Oh my God, people lived like this?"" James Deering sure did!,This is the BEST - a MUST see attraction in Miami. You definitely can spend the day in the Renaissance era and the entire home is original (except the class over the atrium). They included the glass over the atrium to install the air conditioning system. Other than that, each piece of furniture is mostly imported from Venetian palaces. ,The home's entrance is easy to miss and you should have navigation or something like that! Once you are in, visit the spectacular home and the amazingly gorgeous lush gardens. It is incredible to believe that the gardens seen now are just a fraction of yesteryear! The gardens were sold (in part) to the area that Mercy Hospital is on! ,Amazing place! DO NOT MISS OUT!"
"We thought Vizacaya was great.  Been to Miami many, many times but I had never visited Vizcaya.  And my Miami friends only got for weddings. The buildings and gardens are terrific.  You can get a AAA discount.  Count on 2-3 hours -- if like us you skip the tour. ,Here's the deal.  An enormously rich guy, James Deering (International Harvester heir), spends a zillion dollars to build a Venetian palazzo on Biscayne Bay in Coconut Grove, Miami.  The staff at Vizcaya swore that at one time 10% of the total workforce of Miami worked on construction. Can this possibly be true?   ,And this was Deering's winter home.,It's pretty amazing.  ,And you might want to check this out: ,.  You won't find this on the Vizcaya website or in the brochures."
"This is one of my favorite DC memorials. I love how simple and elegant so many of the memorials are in DC and this one is no exception. A circular area with a huge statue of Thomas Jefferson. 4 walls etched with historic documents/sayings.,There are benches around the inside of the memorial where you can sit and gaze toward Jefferson or out toward the Tidal Basin.  You can also sit on the steps on the outside of the memorial. ,There is an area at the ground level where there are bathrooms, a gift shop, and some information about the memorial and Jefferson. There is also an elevator on the ground level that will bring you up to the main memorial level. ,This memorial is completely away from the other sights in DC. We took a cab here. Afterward, we wanted to get another taxi, but they don't come by that often.  If you go here when hardly anyone else is here, have a plan on how to get out."
"National treasure.  What more can you say?  I have actually never gone before this trip.  The view from it was amazing, and is definitely worth the walk over from the mall.  Don't skip this one!"
This is such a beautiful memorial. My wife and I come here late at night when much of Washington is going to sleep. At that time it is peaceful and serene to walk around the memorial and read his words.
"I've never been to the top because the price to pay always sways me so I can't tell you how beautiful he view is haha! But i do like the surrounding areas, especially the huge fountain."
"The Space Needle is a uniquely Seattle spot that everyone should experience at least once. Bring your camera and get some great shots of Seattle and Elliott Bay from the Observation Deck as well as photos of The Needle's iconic profile from various places throughout Seattle Center. ,This is a very tourist focused location and in my opinion, a bit over-priced. Though, if that is what it take to keep The Space Needle an active part of the Seattle skyline then so be it. ,Tips For Your Visit: ,-Try to go on a clear day when Rainier is visible with the naked eye. You will get some spectacular shots. ,-Locals, try to take advantage of coupons and offers for discounted entry so you can take your out-of-towners to experience The Needle without breaking the bank. ,-Relax, enjoy the views, and have drink in the rotating restaurant.,-Check New Years Eve at The Space Needle off of your bucket list...its a blast. ,Tourist locale or not, seeing The Space Needle everyday is one of the things that I missed the most when I didn't live in Seattle. Check it out."
"Great views!  Basically $80 to get 4 of us up to the top...steep (pun intended),It was a slightly overcast day, we weren't able to see as much.,Elevator ride was ok.  We had some folks who didn't care for the ride up or down, especially with the open views, but its a quick ride.,It's a once in a lifetime sort of thing in my opinion.  We contemplated the other observation decks in Seattle but since we were already at the Music Experience, my fate was sealed."
"While the space needle is an icon worth going to and seeing, going up in it is not. At $20, the view is not worth it. You can go to Kerry Park, in Queen Anne and get the same great view, for free. Or the Smith Tower, which is $7.50. The line can be long, especially at sunset or when its sunny. Definitely don't do it if its cloudy. If you are in Seattle and want to do some other things, the City Pass is really worth it and it has 2 passes to the Space Needle. If you have this pass, then its worth checking out, but just spending $20 for a view you can get for free or for $7.50? Not worth it."
"When visiting the Space Needle, you automatically think of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks' all time chick flick of the 90's - Sleepless in Seattle. ,Getting there could be via Monorail from the Westlake Center Mall or via car and pay $15/car/day. Entrance for adults is $18 and this gives you a free online pic of the place and a 360 degree view of Seattle from 520 feet up above the city.  ,The views are spectacular and amazing.  The binoculars allow you to view the city for free! (Usually you have to insert coins or tokens in order to work these machines). All in all this is a wonderful place to take the family or friends to tour Seattle."
"Overrated and overpriced.,It's kinda of cool to get a 360 view of Seattle. Of course, make sure you go on a clear day. Otherwise that's $16 worth of regret. For tourists, the Seattle skyline might be disappointing since it's missing the city's most prominent feature -- the very thing you're standing in.,Tips: Opt for the views from Columbia Center's observation deck ($5) or Kerry Park (free)."
"It's an iconic structure but a kitschy tourist trap in one. I love reading the history of the structure and the views of the city are quite awesome. I like that they have a bar area at the top where you can just lounge, enjoy the views and have a conversation. However the sheer amount of ""space needle"" doo dads is almost nauseating. Anyone catch the price of the food at the restaurant? Holy moly, you can eat at some of the finest restaurant in Seattle for less!"
Absolutely amazing view. 600ft gives you a nice view of the harbor and the city alike. The gift shop has neat little mementos as well.
"Being that it was my first time to Seattle, I wanted to make sure I hit all the tourist traps... just to say I did. And this was definitely a tourist trap. Not in a bad way though! We had a lot of fun! But, yes the elevator ride up to the top is about $18 bucks per person, and once you're at the top there's not much more to do aside from take pictures. But still worth doing in my opinion!! We ended up taking a lot of awesome shots up there, and the 360 degree view is pretty phenomenal. ,You will end up hanging out and grabbing a snack or a coffee at the cafe, just to justify the amount of money you spent to get up to the top of that needle, haha. We managed to spend about an hour or so before heading back down to peruse the gift shop. ,I'd give the space needle a solid 3.5 stars. I'm glad we made the trek out there, it was about 1.5 miles from our downtown hotel on foot. Stopping for a bloody mary on the way helped keep my enthusiasm up at 9 o'clock in the morning (NO JUDGMENT! I WAS TECHNICALLY ON VACATION!), hahaha. Overall great experience :)"
"Seattle's Space Needle, a futuristic building ascending into the sky, showing off technology, beauty and the diverse landscape that is Seattle.  A worthy icon indeed.,From a distance, you can see the unique structure darting the landscape of Seattle.  I feel like I am home when I see this beautiful silhouette on the horizon.  ,A definte on any tourist schedule.  A tad pricey to ride the elevator but worth the experience.  The view is incredible, finding your home through the telescopes is fun, and on clear days, the Cascades are majestic.,I've heard several unfavorable reviews about the quality and price of the restaurant.  Which is disappointing considering how much good food there is in the city, seems like such a waste."
"Ridiculously expensive, poorly run, boring.  It wouldn't be worth the money at half the cost.  Space Needle management appears to have scoured the Seattle public schools to find the most stoned teenage boys and the surliest teenage girls to staff the insufficient number of elevators and overpriced, slow, and nasty tasting concessions.  Enjoy the 15 minute wait for an elevator going up on a floor with no bathroom!  Relish the complete lack of helpful signage!  Luxuriate up top in the absence of comfortable seating!  605 feet of overpriced inconvenience: it's a true Seattle experience."
"Cool enough architecture and makes for a pretty sweet skyline, but not worth the 15ish dollars for the elevator ride to the top.  You go up, you look down, you take a couple pics, you come down.,My advice is:  don't pay to go up the vator.  Just hang out at the Seattle Center and enjoy the atmosphere."
"Came here on a Friday (the day after Christmas) with pretty low expectations.,PARKING: There is a parking lot directly on the premises. If that is full (which was the case for us), you will be able to loop around and go to the parking lot for the Museum of Science. It's right across the street, so it's convenient.,LINES: I think I spent about 2 hours total in line for food and ticketing (about one hour each). I got there around 11 and got in line for food around 1:40, so I'd suggest getting there earlier when there are no lines. ,PRICES: I think that it was pretty affordable, especially if you have your college ID or if you're a senior citizen. Even if you don't get a discount, it's pretty cheap. There should be coupons floating around somewhere, even for a dollar, if you're looking...,THE VILLA: Oh my goodness. Maybe I just went in with super low expectations, but this place is freaking amazing. Every corner of every room was intentionally planned and extremely ornate. I think I probably could have stayed there the entire day, listening to all of the audio tour if I had the time. You'll then go outside to the gardens, which is amazing on its own. And it's right by the water... This guy literally just wanted ways to burn through his money (jk). ,FOOD: I'll provide a more detailed food review in the other page, but the food was actually really good. It's expensive, as expected, but their food quality was really high. ,Bottom line: Everything was really beautiful. I would highly recommend this place for anyone dropping by."
very nice. bought tickets online. no wait time at all. i loved the elevator. the views were nice. a little to expensive. would return again.
"Like the Golden Gate bridge is to San Francisco, so is the Space Needle to Seattle.,As a visitor, I felt it was absolutely mandatory that a visit should be made to this iconic symbol of Seattle. ,We spent most of our time in the SkyCity restaurant, but opted to walk the short flight of stairs to brave the cold of the observation deck. That lasted a whopping 3 minutes! It was colder than a polar bears balls out there! I didn't see anything on the observation deck that I wasn't able to see rotating from the warmth of the restaurant below.,Now I can say that I've been there - done that!"
"On a clear day, the view from the top is amazing. Depending on what time you go, the line seems to vary in wait times (mid-day on a Friday, it took me around 20 minutes) but they wrap you through a balcony that overlooks the gift shop which seems to help you figure out if you want to buy anything later on. ,The price is a bit high ($16 for adults) and it is somewhat of a tourist trap but one of the necessary stops in Seattle. The area surrounding aka the Seattle Center is really cool-they have a children's museum, the international water foundation, the interactive rock-n-roll museum and the start for the 'Ride the Ducks of Seattle' tour. ,They also have a restaurant and cafe there and a huge gift shop; as well as various ticketing options for you to return and see it at night or eat at the restaurant, etc."
"Amazing--all government services should use this model (I'm looking at you, DMV).,They're open at 7:00 am on weekdays. I showed up at 7:06 on a Friday morning to get a new card. I was in and out within 20 minutes.,Tip: Have all your documents with you, filled out, and ready to hand over. It helps the process go even faster."
"Talk about your classic ballparks, Fenway is one of the best classic ballparks still standing in the country today.  You got the green monster(they pronounce it monstah in Boston), very dedicated Red Sox nation, some seats along the third base line that's been there since Fenway opened, and the good ballpark food.  I was there back in '04 and earlier this year when the Giants made their first visit to Fenway in a long time, I believe in the 1930s ) and as a Giant fan I was very impressed of the overwhelming number of  Giants fans made the trip to Beantown and but also how friendly the Red Sox nation treated us.  Although the Giants lost, I enjoyed my surroundings, classic ballpark, two storied pro baseball franchises matching up, and dedicated Sox fans that surrounded us talking baseball."
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.,A large, breezy house. ,Lush, verdant gardens and fountains.,It's like an old-world dream in the New World.,While Husband and I were here for our honeymoon, there was a bride taking pictures in the gardens.,Tickets aren't too expensive and I tricked them into taking my student I.D. Sweet!"
"This is one of the most wonderful, amazing creations!,Go if you are in Miami."
"I really loved strolling through the gardens with my boyfriend (although I was melting in the sweltering heat!). Several parts of the garden were roped off in the middle of restoration, there was still plenty to see and it was nice to sit quietly on a bench and take it all in.,This is a great spot for photo opportunities and people know it - we spotted a handful of people having their quinceanera and wedding portraits taken. But even on a Saturday, it wasn't terribly busy so I still managed to get unobstructed shots of the garden with my own camera.,It was interesting reading about Deering and how he fashioned each room to represent a certain theme, time period or person in history. It's not drop dead elaborate like some famous European landmarks but I'd like to point out, it's not a European landmark. It's a really beautiful expression by Deering of some of the things he admired - and in Miami of all places, to re-imagine an English/Renaissance garden in a tropical setting is a charming effort.,I would agree with some reviewers that the admission price could probably be a bit lower if you consider having to pay for a whole family to get in - it's a bit pricey at $10-15 a person. I'm all for supporting local historical landmarks but it's difficult to do that if you can't afford it."
This is a great memorial to the main man who wrote the Declaration of Independence. There are some very interesting quotes particularly one on the back wall that really made me think about the way the United States Government makes laws. It definitely made me think and think maybe some Senators and Congressman should take a stop by here and reflect on this memorial and the thoughtful quotes.
"Didn't see a game here, I know that's lame. Did take the tour. Fell in love with the tour guide, thus this review. Place is green, there's grass in the middle and some stuff, whatever. Cute tourguide gets it 4 stars. Seriously though, the park is cool, great history and views. Could only imagine watching a game here instead of at The Phone Booth (att park)."
Very pretty and restrooms are clean. Bad part is no changing table in the bathroom. You will do a lot of walking so make sure to wear comfortable shoes because lots of grass and uneven pavement in the gardens and lots of stairs inside the mansion. Parking is free and very accessible. If you have a student ID be sure to bring it or even use your AAA card for $1 discount. Food was a bit pricey but pretty good compared to most cafes I have ever been to. Also the grounds and cafe was very clean even though it rained outside and people were tracking water every where.
"Vizcaya is one of the few examples of what can be accomplished when you give interior decorators and architects unlimited money. So, if you want to know, you have to go, and you will be in for a treat.,The setting on the water, over looking the bay couldn't be more perfect. The structure itself is awesome, and though Deering must have paid for it all, it was a robbery of some of the finest treasures of Europe. ,The sad part is that when it was first completed the grounds were much larger, there were canals with gondolas, but those are gone and can only now be imagined. ,In all, Vizcaya is treasure of South Florida both historically and also the way it stands today."
"I was very disappointed in Vizcaya, but not totally, I expected so much more from this place. Where should I start  this narrative, how about with  the positives.,Nice mansion with some interesting architectural style's. Many of the room's are stuck in time, they seem almost untouched since the last residents inhabited the mansion. ,The landscape architecture  ( the stone and coral structure's) are impeccable, the layout enables you to have a nice picturesque walk. There are also  a  few nice water fountains and spouts, with a few large creatively designed gazebo like structure's.,      ,There are many Grecian Romanesque type sculptures to be appreciated here. The sculptures are predominately bust's and  naked bodies with  a leaf covering the private part.,Now the bad. They do not allow pictures to be taken inside of the mansion, which is kind of silly.Most of the people were taking video and pictures anyway, as there are no curators monitoring the rooms and hallways. Some areas of the Mansion seem to be in a state of disrepair.,They claim they have these luscious gardens, what? where? What I saw was mainly one species of  hedge vegetation with the odd plant here or there. I mean what I saw was  vague repetitive  lackluster landscape design, almost a total waste. I noticed some sections of the garden were just recently planted with a  mimicking design of other parts of the garden, what a Joke. One would assume the gardens to have been planted decades ago.,Some of the most attractive  waterways and fountains were not even working, there was no water in many of the waterways. Other stationary pools looked like they had not be cleaned since Jimmy Carter was president. There was this one really attractive romantic area behind this above ground level gazebo overlooking a creek and the water smelled like sewage. There was a couple of other spots in the very back of the mansion along the ocean front that had  a bunch of gobbly gook in the water and it also smelled really bad.,Basically this place is a big let down, from its general void in maintenance to the so-called gardens. I did not smell one aromatic flower at any time or point walking in and around  their ""gardens"".Outside of the small orchids near the picnic area there are hardly any exotic flowers., I have personally visited the impeccably kept  Rose Hall ""specter"" Mansion in Jamaica. While walking the magnificent gardens of the Alcazar and Alhambra in Andalusia Spain, I  was intoxicated by the exotic aromatic flowers beautifully lined along the  cobble stone walkways. While seeking the ancient grandeur of China, my eyes graced the beautiful spirit infused Fengshui designed Confucius Temple Gardens in Shanghai.  , Vizcaya??? It  cannot compare, not even close, not in any remote way or form. Although Vizcaya cannot be classed with the aforementioned places, it has potential but the management just crap its potential down the el drain'o.,If anyone asked me if they should go visit this place, I would say no, even though the entrance fee is only 15$. Not unless there was a radical change in management of this facility. ,On a last note you should leave these kind of places with your mind and spirit  floating on clouds, not remembering sewage smell or bemoaning this or that was not on or working, or man they could have did this or that to the so-called garden."
"A must do and one of the three best memorials in DC. Love seeing Jefferson's many informative quotes on the walls here, great statue and view of DC from here (be careful for the steps here because they are slippery). Also love the little museum dedicated to him on the first floor (their is so much stuff there, i just suggest that you go). Definite must do and like the Lincoln memorial, will leave you in awe."
"This memorial and statue is simply amazing.  It is sort of in its own section of the National Mall and there is no mistaking or skipping this memorial.  The actual building that houses Jefferson's statue is absolutely massive and one of the few memorials that has different levels/elevators and even a gift shop. ,The building itself is magnificent looking - the tall white pillars out front make it look very royal and profound.  You have to walk up a number of steps to get inside the memorial, and once you are in, you see the Jefferson statue.  The statue is beautiful and very tall.  Very cool to take pictures of and in front of.  When you get inside by the statue, just look up at the ceiling and the artwork/sculpting on the ceiling looks amazing.,There are also plenty of famous quotes/speeches throughout the memorial.  This is another can't miss memorial when you are in DC."
"Right across the lake from the Lincoln is the Jefferson.  This is a circular covered room with T.J. standing and his speeches surrounding him on the walls.  People, like myself, can just stay and stare for an hour and the guy and his 4 walls of text.  Cool thing is that he gets his own area, but not the same amount of foot traffic.  Easy to park and see it, and walking from the parking lot to the memorial, you see a statue of George Mason chillin on a bench.  Only reason I knew of him was from the NCAA basketball tournament."
"The Space Needle is a Seattle institution. Ask any out of towner what's the first thing that they want to see when they visit Seattle..and 9/10 will say...The Space Needle. It's definitely worth seeing at least once or twice. Although getting a good picture with it is a pain in the butt. As for the $25 ticket ride up (I believe that's the price), that's a HUGE rip off IMO, which is why the Space Needle only gets 4 rather than 5 stars.,   I have been up at the observatory deck after I ate dinner at the Sky City restaurant in the Space Needle, and you do get good views though, and nice pictures...if the weather is nice. If you have friends or family coming in from out of town, you have to bring'em here, and if they want to go up..I recommend just eating at the restaurant, at least you get a little more of your money's worth.,~G ,p.s. I wish I could afford those $80 space needle pepper mills, cus they are flippin' sweet."
"Felt like a checked off an item on my bucket list.  I'm glad I went... Seattle is beautiful and you can see sweeping views of Mount Rainier, the Pacific Ocean and all other Seattle landmarks.  I'm glad I came!"
"If you're ever in Seattle, you MUST visit the Space Needle!  The view from the top shows you and aerial view of the various, diverse sections of the city and Safeco Field.  Before you ascend to the top, they make you take a picture with a back drop of the Needle, and while the picture came out awkward for my friend and I, it was something to laugh at."
"What a beautyfull view, absolutly to do !!!"
"Ditched a sweltering, long 1.5 hour+ line during the mid-day tourist rush so we could catch a few additional attractions with our Go Seattle Card (a must!) in time. ,Came back around sunset and there was no line at all! Definitely a must as it is an icon of the city.,Not much to say other than spend some quality time at the top. We got to watch the sun go down, and catch some beautiful views of the mountains and city surrounding.,**My only complaint was the cranky gal who worked there. I have dubbed her the ""Prop Nazi."" ,Since there was no crowd, we stopped to take a snapshot with the giant prop coffee cup sitting right when you get inside next to the photo stations before heading up. And we were quickly reprimanded by her with no explanation except that ""those are for US to use!"" We weren't even touching it. And then to see the same lady handed the same props to other people having their complimentary photo taken. Thanks for not giving us that option? We look rightfully perturbed in our photo. *,So have fun, get the Go Seattle Card if you're going to hit up multiple tourist attractions, enjoy the view, and don't touch anything! ; )"
"OH SEATTLE.... HOW I LOVE THEE!!,I already felt like we live in the most beautiful city, ever.... but, after going up in the Space Needle today, I now KNOW that we do.  OMG, Seattle is just the most gorgeous city, with beauty no matter where you looked out from the observation deck.  The elevator ride was a decent pace up, and you get to look out over Seattle on your way.  They have a little area, inside, where you can grab a bite to eat, and sit at a table overlooking breathtaking views.  You can walk around outside as well..... and there are several view scopes all around to get a much closer look at the sites.  I can't wait for my mom to come up, next month, so I can have an excuse to go up, once again!!!!"
"It's one of those places where you have to visit just to say you've been there.,I preferred seeing the needle outside than actually being inside of it. The building is architecturally interesting, however the view from the top was alright. If you've been to Coit Tower in San Francisco, its a similar view of buildings, buildings and more buildings.,Perhaps if I am ever in Seattle again, I will visit the Space Needle at night. I think the view would be spectacular. Props to the cashier guy for telling us to wait out the fog before heading up."
"Definitely a place to visit if you have never been to Seattle but other than that it's simply a landmark. It's worth coming to because the surrounding area is awesome. The Armory, EMP Museum, and Native American Totem Poles make the surrounding area pretty awesome and picture perfect. I don't think it's worth the $20 to go up and see the view of Seattle. But taking a picture of the Space Needle from the Bottom is pretty cool."
"it has been afew years since I have gone . but it was fun and sunny that day.,they would have been the second trip to the needle but the First time to the top.,So if you you are traveling with someone special  who crys a little because they did not  get to go to  the top the first time there or but your self  it is ablast.,I heart  they have food too."
"As a tourist, I of course wanted to visit the Space Needle. It's not as tall as I expected and we spent no more than 15 minutes before we were ready to go. Great views of Seattle, but definitely a one-time visit kind of thing. They do take your pics and you're able to email them to yourself once you get up top. ,The lady in the elevator was like, don't worry, there's no Starbucks in the elevator. I replied, ""not yet."" HAR HAR HAR"
The space needle is pretty cool at night.
"Not a bad view of the city, bay, mountains in the distance on a clear day, probably. Indoor and outdoor viewing is possible. Snacks available. Free long distance viewers. Fast elevators, too... the operator will gladly tell you that it moves at 10mph. It's also a pretty impressive structure from the ground."
"It's tall. It's cool. It has a gift shop. This is the de rigeur stop for tourists, and heck, it is pretty fun the first time. Check out where your house is, and how small cars look on I-5. Take the tourists. Make them pay.,Really only fun for one visit. I like looking at it from down below better, to be honest."
"The Space Needle is a must see, from the outside. The exterior conjures up all of the 1950s and 60's dreams about the final frontier yet the interior doesn't pull its weight. ,I recommend paying less to take the elevator to the top of the Columbia Tower where you will get much closer to space and will be able to look down upon the Space Needle in context with the rest of the city. Alternatively, at the Columbia Tower, you can reportedly take the elevator most of  the way up for free if you're heading to the Starbucks up there. It has nice views too. ,Now, the Tower observation deck isn't outdoors or quite 350-degrees, but I think it's cooler than being inside the Needle. ,Also check out the observation deck in the Smith Tower which is supposed to be full of cool architecture and is open on weekends when the CT isn't."
Really magnificent. Words can't describe how beautiful Vizcaya is. Come visit during the spring or winter when the weather isn't too hot. It truly is a Miami treasure! Pro tip: bring your student id for a discount!
"Vizcaya is breathtaking! I can only imagine how magnificent it was during its prime. There must have been grand celebrations both in the ornate home and on the lavish grounds.,The house is nice but I was most impressed by the landscape of the many gardens, fountain areas, gazebos, trees and flowers. It made me want to renew my wedding vows on the lawn or attend a tea party Oceanside in the gazebo. ,You really have to see it-words are not enough. Pics help though so check em out.,$2 off admission discount cards for Vizcaya are available at most hotels or visitor centers. Regular price is $18 adults. I think kids are free."
"About half the size of the Sears Tower which I've been to, but you can see some good views of downtown from here such as Safeco Park. The only problem is the other areas you can see are mostly residential which I find to be boring. The telescopes they have there are powerful enough so that you actually see someone inside Safeco Park. My friend who I went with actually saw her car parked from a parking garage which was somewhat of a walk away. It was crazy seeing it zoomed in though. I wish I had a better camera to take pictures of the landmarks though. A point and shoot camera simply won't work at night."
"Please go to the Space Needle at least once in your lifetime.  The view from the top is breathtaking.  I even experienced the rain and wind outside.  Even in not-so-perfect weather, the experience is refreshing!"
"To sum it up: Pricey, parking sucks, a few shady people hanging around outside...but overall, the view is beautiful and well worth the visit."
"Recently went to Washington for business and I had to squeeze in a visit to the space needle on the way to the airport. $17 bucks to take an elevator ride up 520 feet to the observation deck. The only difference from this to the the Empire State Building in NY is that the elevator is outside the building so you can see the view as you go up. Pretty nice view, I saw it during the day but would love to see the lights at night."
I went with my father to do at least four social security transactions; we were both in and out within twenty minutes. Take the 4 train to fulton street and walk to williams street. The SSA office is on the third floor.
"Some people go to church, I go to Fenway.  There is no where else where you walk in a immediately realize that you are entering baseball history.  The fans here are also the best.  I now live in Oakland and am constantly reminded about how passionate everyone is at Fenway.  The crowd is really into the game and cheering a screaming and I miss Fenway so much!"
"We've visited Vizcaya twice and it's a ""must-see"" in Miami.  It's in a beautiful old mansion which backs up to the water, in a setting that's somewhat reminiscent of Venice - and it has beautiful gardens & fountains.  If you're there on a week-end, you'll undoubtedly see a few brides having photos taken."
"i love this place.  it really is beautiful!  not a huge garden, but it's very nice to walk around and spend the day here.  i spent 3 hours and had lunch here, so it was worth the admission price.  they have lots of parking, and i came on a weekday so it was pretty empty.  i picked up the self-guided audiotour at the ticket booth and was on my way.  the audiotour is excellent and takes you through both the gardens and the house.  there's lots of art and beautiful architecture in the house, but photography is not allowed (though most people didn't care to follow this rule... boooo...).  but still, you might want to bring your camera so you can take some nice pictures outside in the gardens.  there are lots of lizards sunning themselves on the walls.  ,there were a few photographers taking pictures for some girls' quinceaneras but it's not too hard to avoid them.,the cafe is small (like a food truck) and you eat outside amongst the local cat population.  the lemon tuna salad was delicious and the unsweeted iced tea was perfect for the heat.  ,the giftshop is in a tent next to the cafe.  they have lots of postcards of the gardens and museum (which was perfect since you can't take pictures inside).  ,it was the perfect place for me to come and relax in Miami during spring break!"
"If you want to use a camera, this is the place for it! ,Enough said. This place is very beautiful, and hopefully they get all of the fountains working, as well as the interior portion of the house completed. ,Right now it's at a discount, so get it while you can."
"Definitely one of our favorite memorials in DC. Although, it is a walk to get there so plan accordingly. I recommend good shoes and a backpack filled with water and snacks. Once you arrive, the stairs make a good picnic spot.,Great memorial. I wish that it was better taken care of, for instance Jefferson's statue had cob webs and dust all over."
"A cool place to go once.  I had a good time, bars outside, people around were great and actually paid attention to the game, unlike people here in LA.  While it does give the great old school ballgame feel, there are parts that annoy.  Big posts in the middle of stands block a lot of people's view.  Seats are kinda angled crappy, and not many seats available, make it pretty exp.  The game was great and experience was fun.  So I'm glad I went, but probably won't again."
"This is a great place to visit on your vacation or for a date. My boyfriend came up with this idea and I fell in love with the place. The museum is a phenomenal place to visit. I really love this place. It was a very successful business man's mansion before it turn into a museum in the 1930's. This place is great to take engagement and wedding pictures. In addition, to see the whole estate inside and outside, you need to come here from open to close. Also, they provide student discounts."
"This museum is very pretty! Shows elegance and class! Everything there looked so expensive. And the history behind everything is worth going! ,Photography allowed outside but not permitted inside.,It is a lot of walking to do, so plan accordingly. Try not to go on a very hot day. Bring cold bottled water.,Tried to find the room where The Mandarin(from Iron man) was hidden but failed, must be in one of those hidden rooms! LOL!,Military people get in FREE!"
"If you are interested in antiques, history, and beautiful gardens, then this is the place for you!  This home is stunningly beautiful both inside and out.  I highly recommend the guided first floor tour.  Without the tour, I would not have understood the magnitude to what I saw.  This is not the best place to bring small children and toddlers, unless they stay in the gardens."
Doing some cool night photography there. I am looking forward to a good cherry blossom season!
"""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal..."",Jefferson's eloquent word are immortalized in the marble, a reminder of his strong hand in shaping our nation's ideals. The Memorial is neatly housed in a dome, surrounded by the Tidal Basin, and accented by a myriad of cherry blossom trees (peak bloom is around the end of March).,Tips: It's a long walk. Take the tour bus to get there."
It's one of the nicest memorials (FDR is my personal fav) but again - its suuuuuuuuuuch a hike to get there.  Or maybe i'm just a lazy ass... either way its not exactly close to a metro.  gorgeous when the cherry blossoms are in bloom though.
"Other than Pike Place Market, the Space Needle is a MUST SEE for any tourist visiting the beautiful, clean city of Seattle. The boy and I trekked our way past Belltown over to the Space Needle. We couldn't wait to board the copper-tinted bullet elevator that would take us up to the highest point in Seattle. Sure, $16/ticket is a bit steep for an elevator ride, but the view from above is more than worth it. (get a $2 off coupon, see below),The lines for the elevator moved rather quickly, as groups were sectioned off and separated before boarding in fashion a la Disneyland. The ride up to the top wasn't as quick as, say the glass elevators at The Hotel in Vegas. Still, there were still a couple of riders who had a slight case of vertigo. Push your way to the front if possible to enjoy the views on the short ride up. Elevator attendants barely had any time to introduce this Seattle landmark, and in what seemed like less than a minute, we were at the top. ,Immediately, the boy and I skipped all the ""interesting facts"" posters and interactive touch screen programs that introduced all that is the Seattle Space Needle. We headed straight for the tiny stairs that led outside for the view. It was magnificent. Secure railings lined with thick plexi-glass surrounded the exterior while still providing maximum visibility of what was above and below. I know some yelpers have mentioned going up the space needle only to find 20% visibility, but this was indeed not the case for us this past clear and sunny weekend. To avoid any steel lines from obstructing any of my pictures of the view, I extended my hand outside past the railings- sans plexi - to get a clear shot.  It was such a beautiful day to linger up top. We walked fully around the needle to take in everything. ,Tip #1: Find a Seattle booklet (available in most hotels) for $2 off coupon. ,Tip #2: Take the Monorail back to downtown- only $2/person one-way."
"Simply amazing! Its worth spending the $18 to get to the to top. It can get really crowded at times. We went on a cloudy/slightly rainy afternoon and avoided the lines. The food in the cafe at the top tasted delicious, especially the salmon panini. There is a rotating restaurant on the second to the top floor. However, it is a bit expensive. We just went there for the amazing view!"
"The Space Needle costs about $1 a minute. That's cheaper than psychic hotlines, but not by much. To be fair, you're not forced to exit the premises after 19 minutes... but if you're not a weary travel resting your tired feet, that's probably about as long as you're going to last.,Don't get me wrong, I love the Space Needle. As a relatively new resident of Seattle, it's an embodiment of what it means to live here. There are more gritty, less touristy things that make Seattle great but none of them will ever be as recognizable as the Space Needle. It offers you great views and a perspective generally unrivaled in the city. It's a monument worth having.,I just can't wait until an annual pass Groupon comes along again.,P.S. - Do yourself a favor and have a few beers before you visit. It's way fun that way!"
"I had been looking forward to going up in the space needle for a very long time. Unfortunately, the day I went was a cold rainy day in December. However, the good thing about that was short lines. The price ($18) was a bit much considering there really isn't much to do once you are up there, but the view even on a rainy day is awesome. The gift store in the base of the needle has a good variety of souvineers, though most of them are overpriced. I was however able to pick up some sale items without spending a fortune. As others have said, definately get the picture before going up!! It is very cool and you will be able to access it later via the web for free! Overall, the experience is worth it, and now I can officially say I was up in the needle!"
"I love the Space Needle. It's as quintessential to Seattle's identity as the Pike Place Market and Grunge music. I mean, come'on, who doesn't love the fact that we have a six hundred foot phallus right in the center of our city. Also, it's the perfect landmark for describing where I live near for people who don't know where lower Queen Anne is.,The only thing that kind of suck is I have to pay $16 every time one of my friends from out of town visits and wants to go to the top."
"Recognizable around the world as the defacto symbol of Seattle. Views of downtown Seattle, Puget Sound, and the surrounding neighborhoods are simply spectacular. Don't call it ""The Stratosphere"" or they will black list you! I rode the Monorail from the Westgate Mall downtown to get here for $2.25."
"Went here for the first time after living in Seattle for over 10 years. ,We did not make reservations and/or plan on coming here so I was happy they were able to get us in right away. :),I had the seafood alfredo and my boyfriend had the 8 oz. steak and we had some drinks and topped it off with their most famous dessert which is the one that has all the smoke coming out of it. ,+seafood alfredo- I did not like the sauce. It tasted a little sour. Since I didn't like the sauce I couldn't really enjoy the stuff inside of it. I also thought the sauce was a bit watery. BUT I did enjoy the scallops. Nice and tender!,+8 oz.. steak- We asked for a little pink. It was basically rare except for the outside of it. It was so crispy on the outside! And the potatoes were excellent!,+dessert- It was fun but ....there were literally like 1 and a half scoops of ice cream in there for like 10 dollars. WOW....AND barley any caramel sauce. ,For the finale, my boyfriend and I went up to the observation deck and I got my soy latte and he got his pepperoni stick and we looked outside till they were just about to close.,All in all, a great night."
"The space needle provides gorgeous panoramic views of Seattle and the mountains.  It's a breathtaking view, really, especially at sunset.  Yes, it's a bit expensive and crowded, but it's a tourist spot, so what do you expect?  The attendants were really nice and seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, which is a plus in my book.  I think visiting the space needle is something everyone should do once while in Seattle!"
"No touristy excursion around Seattle would be complete without a visit to the Space Needle. There's not much more to say about it, except that the elevator ride up is as much fun as the observation deck above."
"Obviously, a trip to Seattle must include the space needle.  It's like a trip to the E.R. after a car accident will guarantee you a RECTAL EXAM.  It's just plain inevitable.  The structure itself is just a tall pole that collects $16 for each elevator ride, but dining at the rotating restaurant gets you to the top for free.  I don't recommend that, though, 'cuz the meals are like at least $40 each and are not even worth $40 - $16 = $24 each.  If you are looking for a great view of the Seattle skyline, Kerry Park offers it for $0.  Street parking is usually not bad and only costs $1.25 per hour.  I wish the U. Dub. E.R. parking lot was this affordable.,1 star off: $16 for a 41 second elevator ride"
"Clean, safe, great views.,Ticket is too expensive.,A Coke is 3 bucks.,Still better than any building or tower that Vancouver BC has to offer."
"Terrible prices, terrible food."
"Vizcaya Museum and Gardens is a beautiful 1916 estate! If you like taking pictures (of gardens or yourself), then you must visit Vizcaya. Be prepared to run into many (engagement, quinceañera, etc.) photoshoots.,A few tips:,-bring your student ID (if applicable),-pay $5 for the audio tour,-arrive before 1pm"
"I was more excited at the fact that (on the observation deck) I could read faraway signs through the telescopes and spot people walking around that I couldn't see with my normal sight. Oh, and the rest of the views were pretty nice too."
"Way over priced!!  $18.90 (after tax) for adults.  Valet is $15 for 4 hours.  If you stay over 4 hours, the price doubles!  Valet is $8 if you eat in their restaurant, but you will spend more in the restaurant than if you had just paid for the regular parking fee ($20 for a burger).  ,We weren't planning on going up because of the reviews and the price.  However, our last day had AMAZING weather.  It was sunny and clear and we thought it would be a great day, if there ever was one, to go up and see the city.  Thankfully, it was a good view overlooking the city.  But if the weather is not clear, don't bother going up, you won't see much and for what you're paying, it's even more of a waste of your money!  ,I know you probably associate Seattle with the Space Needle and you feel you just HAVE to go up if you're visiting.  I would suggest Kerry Park for a lovely view of the city (and the needle will be IN your photos), Mt. Rainer included!  ,Also, keep in mind you will most likely wait at LEAST 30 minutes in line to go up.  If money is but an object to you and you feel like blowing roughly $20 per person (sucks if you have a big party with you), then forget the review and just do it  because it doesn't matter to you anyway ;)"
"Seattle space needle is an iconic symbol & the city is an aweinspiring place to visit and work. The architecture was done by an alien -no i'm kidding. Companies really go out of their way to accomodate their employee's with nothing but the best benefits and amenities. The city climate offers all 4 seasons, especially the one where it rains. Trees turn orange in the fall & it snows in the winter. @ $18 a climb, the top hosts majestic view of Mount Rainier, stadiums & pier. Picture taking is available at ground level and well worth it because the frame is durable and easy to file. fondest memory of the space needle was the 1 year where the fireworks on New Years was delayed couple minutes. had a good chuckle. thanks, it was an experience."
"How can a government office be so efficient and friendly?  I will not apply words like friendly, fast, efficient and knowledgeable to a government office but this one is GREAT!  everyone is friendly from the building security to everyone in the SSN office.  I was literally in and out of there in 5 minutes.,My guy was so great, he knows his stuff.  Took out my marriage certificate and immediately knew which state it was.  Made small not uncomfortable small talks with me and was done in two minutes.,If you need to go to the SSN this one is the one."
"One of my favorite places on Earth!  I've been a proud Sox fan since birth.  It brings back the days when my Dad and I would go to see Yaz.  I still get excited when I walk through the gates and catch a glimpse of the field.  I have been to other ball parks and Fenway definitely has the most charm and authenticity.  The seats are not comfortable and you'll probably have to go to a chiropractor if you don't get up at all (jk), but you can't beat the nostalgia and history this place offers!!  I wouldn't change anything- the smells, the crazy fans, the Fenway franks.  I'll keep coming back.  The only thing I could (and will) complain about are the prices!!!  So expensive!  I'm lucky b/c I have access to season tickets, but to pay for a game, you may as well take out a loan."
"this makes for a pleasant stroll if you have a free afternoon. i'm generally a history enthusiast, and yet i don't remember anything interesting about the history of this place."
"Minus one star for all the Mis Quincinera girls everywhere! It felt like at least a third of the gardens were off limits. Though, I can't really blame them for wanting their pictures taken there; the gardens were really beautiful. ,It was a nice surprise and a highlight of my trip to Miami. We spent about two hours here visiting James Deering's old home, listening to the organ and imagining what it was like to stay here when it was in its finest condition. What parties did he have? Who is James Deering and did he have an affair with his housekeeper? Was she the only female in the house, or was the affair with his male driver? No other residents were mentioned. Well, what about his other servants? Did he always have guests in his numerous guest rooms? Just how many farm machines did he have to sell to create a place like this? I want a secret door like this! And so on, and so on. It was a fun, imaginative day. ,Just don't get in the way of one of those Mis Quincinera girls. Their entourage will scrunch up their noses at you and you know it isn't from the nearby sea water."
"So beautiful and graceful, especially during cherry blossom season. We were glad we picked up a DC Monuments app, as it had some good history I hadn't heard before. ,Yes, it can be difficult to access. Here's what you do: head down Maine Ave SW for cheap covered parking at Phillip's restaurant. Then walk down the Maine Avenue fish market and pick up some amazing fresh crabcakes (Jimmy's, Captain White's, others), pies, and other goodies. Take your lunch to the grounds of the Jefferson Memorial and picnic under the cherry blossoms. Voila!"
"I have the opportunity to see Fenway Park from a different perspective than your average Red Sox fan. I get to see it from onstage while setting up lights and sound for a concert, and from backstage during the concerts there. I have sat in the dugout. I have set up musician's dressing rooms in the Clubhouse. I have loaded trucks full of equipment out on Lansdowne Street. I've also seen the sun come come up over the Green Monster. It's a beautiful and unique view of the place, but it is a very difficult to work there. Fenway was not meant to be a concert venue. It is an antique ballpark, and I hope it stays that way forever."
huge property. Good for taking pictures for a wedding or quince. We visit often as a family and just love this place. There is always a buzz of activity with wedding planning. the tour of the home is very interesting but the grounds especially the court yards are amazing.
"I had no idea who Mr. Deering was or what he did prior to my visit here. I just knew, from looking at the website prior to going, that it had a house and a nice garden. I like looking at old houses and my mom likes gardens. It was a win-win. Adult admission is $18, $10 for students with IDs and I believe $12 for seniors (+62). The car entrance into the museum is unassuming and we missed it on the first go. The house had plenty of rooms to explore. The details in the rooms and furnitures were amazing. The garden is massive and is quite a popular place for photo shoots. When we went on Saturday, there was at least 5-6 different photo shoots going on. They also have a cafe on site."
"Probably my favorite attraction in Miami.  The gardes are beautiful and the sculputures are in awe.  ,The house his so beautiful, but the garden is the ultimate attraction.  I loved the fountains, steps, the ship, the scenery.  Everything.  It's a place you won't regret going to."
I* can't even began to explain about how beautiful the Jefferson Memorial is. I was in amazement of the beauty that if holds. Make sure you read the beautiful quotes that surround him and the walls of the Memorial.
Very nice view of the tidal basin. During Cherry Blossom season.. it's an amazing view.. and there are performances at the Jefferson Memorial.
The place definitely look a lot better at night since the light reflect of the water around the memorial park. His statue is one of a kind and it definitely make him look a lot more alive. If you like Jefferson you will definitely appreciate his memorial.
"Definitely a tourist trap, but you simply cannot travel to Seattle & not go to the top. The restaurant was closed for 'seasonal renovations' last month while we were there, which was disappointing, and the little cafe only had hot dogs and pizzas out of their whole menu; that was a drag (but in their defense, the hot dog was quite good). ,It was quite cold walking around the outside up top (duh, it was January..hehe) but the view was quite cool & it was cute to hear kids ask which way was Canada because they wanted to be able to tell people that they'd seen it. *smiles*  The little binoculars placed around the outside were quite cool, too, I must say; I have to say that I was surprised that they were free.,The prices in the gift shop were substantial, but I have to say, their merchandise is quality stuff; my t-shirt may have cost $20, but it's well made & will last much longer than the flimsy $5 shirt from the booth across the way.,All in all an enjoyable experience; I'm glad we went while we were in Seattle."
"It's the emblem of our city: the space-age landmark that, unless you live in San Francisco, Paris, Rio, Sydney or the like, makes your home town's distinctive public works look like mechanistic piles of bleh.,No, the Needle of Space is our city's proud boner: a graceful, tumescent phallus arching ever skyward, filling our vision with its bulbous, penetrative terminus. Wherever you go you will see it, whether gleaming in the sun or gently shaded from beneath by the glow of the city at night, as if by candle light..."
"I've never been one for obvious sight seeing structures like the Eiffel Tower, Empire State Building, (although I've been to the Sears Tower) but the Space Needle is pretty cool. I'm glad I had brunch at the SkyCity restaurant which offers complimentary observation deck viewing. I would not have been happy paying the $19 to get up to then pay $$ for drinks and snacks. There are other great views of the city that are complimentary (e.g., Kerry Park, Gaswork Park, etc.) try those instead if you want a great view."
"Cool experience.....but its a ""one and done"" folks!"
"I admit it. ,I paid $16 to go when I was a tourist.,Will I go again as a newly transplanted ""local""?,Only if I have to take another tourist.,TIP: Only go on a clear day and at sunset to get the most out of your moo-lah. That way, you'll see the cityscape both in daytime and the nighttime city lights."
"Fantastic view of the city, highly recommend to vacationers like myself."
"Who doesn't love this place? I've been up several times and it never gets old. Beautiful views and amazing food. To eat up there in the restaurant you are going to take a pretty penny out to do but you will never forget your meal. The food is to die for and not to mention the view you get while dining. My husband is in the US Navy and we had his re-enlistment ceremony up on top on the observation deck and it was definitely memorable. The staff are great, friendly and accommodating. The only downfall is the prices but definitely worth what you get. Also if you drive there you will probably be paying for parking too but that is how it goes in Seattle so can't expect much else. This is definitely a place to go at least once in your life! And if you have the extra cash it is worth it to dine up above the emerald city as well!"
"Its the Space Needle what do you review??!! It is really expensive to ride though and I wish there was a local discount or something. But, go see it if you are a tourist."

"We love this restaurant! It is romantic and the setting at night is fantastic!!! We will eat here every chance we get... The Dungeness crab and Artichoke Dip was the best and you have to try the Penn Cove Manila Clams drizzled with lemon, it is so good. We are very enthusiastic about returning to Seattle just to eat here and duplicate our experience."
"In Seattle, 2 must places to visit is the pike place market and the space needle.  To visit the top floor or the space needle is a bit pricey, but when accompanied with friends - its all worth. What made it fun is that we're all scared of heights, so you can imagine us going up the elevator like a bunch of pansies. lol,Once reaching the top, it gives such a beautiful view of the entire city! Whats great about the needle is the freedom of circling the entire platform to get pictures from all angles.,If going, please go when there's no forecast of rain and/or cloudy skies in order to truly appreciate the sight."
"""must see in seattle""  i put that in quotations because I got really tired of seeing that everyday on my trip.  Yes this structure is nice and it is the landmark of seattle but it wasn't worth the money to ride an elevator.  It's pretty pricey we paid $20 to have 2 trips up to the observation deck, one in the day and one at night.  It was nice for the first 5 min up there but after that it got really dull."
"i mean, it's the space needle. you cant visit seattle and not make a stop here. there's a neat little free app to compliment your visit with photo and info about the landmark. it's a pricey trip to the top, imho, but again...a must-do, offering a 360 view of the seattle area. skip the cafe and check out the food-court-ish place near the childrens museum. oh, and visit the chihuly museum next door!"
"I almost regret paying to see what the hype was all about, but I guess I wouldn't know if I didn't do it. Yea.. it was just OK. Definately not worth the $16 general admission in my opinion. Maybe $10."
It's a place to go if you get the citypass other than that it will cost you $20 for a free souvenir photo a minute ride up the elevator. It's a decent view but nothing impressive if you've done something similar. Also the view scopes are free to use.
"Ah the Space Needle...the mark of Seattle. Everyone knows what the Space Needle is of course; thus that's probably why they charge so much for you to go up and see it. ,They used to have it so the ticket was also a coupon worth 8 bucks off your meal in the restaurant, but I think they discontinued doing this. And if you ever go into the restaurant, you realize that the 8 bucks would have only gotten you a glass of water anyway. You def go to the restaurant for the experience/atmosphere, not the food.,The observation tower though is def cool, and worth their outrageous fees. Especially on a clear day it is SOOO beautiful, and you can see SOOO much. Def a must see if you see Seattle. And they even have a little Starbucks for you to have coffee at, as well as the usual over priced tourist items."
"We absolutely love touring this beautiful home and spending time on the grounds - the views of the Atlantic as well as Miami are inspiring.,The gardens are beautiful; beautifully designed and well-maintained.  Lots of photo ops! Stunning really.  Find a shady spot and enjoy the changes in light and shadow under the mature trees. Visually YUMMY!!,The café had some tasty offerings and the little shop had some interesting finds.,Well worth the visit; will go again when in the Miami area, lovely and truly a view into the good life!!"
"One time, the Space Needle tried to follow me home.  I said, 'Hey, there, little Space Needle, why are you trying to follow me home?'  And, the Space Needle said:,'I am but a friendly Seattle landmark:,an anachronism for a future that failed to happen.,I am a reminder to all who see me that ,if you punch a dog, Mom will yell at you.',I said, 'Uh.'"
"Ok, sooo....when you think of Seattle...you think of the Space Needle...right? My 3 yr old loves trains...all trains...monorails, trolleys, streetcars...so...we took the monorail from the Westlake Center to Space Needle. Cost is $18 for adults (single) or $24 for night and day. You take a photo in front of nothing that you know later they will be putting a photo of the space needle behind you! You ride up and well, though I thought they should have made it exciting, they didn't. Just get in the elevator and go. Once you get up there, they let you out, explaining hours of the observation deck and that's it. On the deck we circled it about twice...looking through a couple of telescopes to view the city. It was pretty cold, but it's seattle...come dressed appropriately. The views are pretty...i took lots of photos...they are a must see. There is a little cafe that sells hot dogs, soups, coffee, snacks. Relaxed indoors and hung out a little bit. Before heading down, we take a look at the photo...you get to email it...but i would have purchased one if my son's eyes weren't closed! They should have seen it that and taken another one. That was terrible. And as usual, you exit through the gift shop where everything is pretty much expensive. The experience was great for the family...but they can use some extra fun/customer service/excitement in that place! Oh, we went on a Thursday...around 2 pm...not busy at all!"
"Spectacular views,,spin chef's plates into garbage.,Stay grounded, human."
"A must have experience in Seattle!  Beautiful view and you can stay up there as long as you want and have a coffee over great conversation.  There is an indoor portion and a outdoor portion, so you don't have to worry about weather.  The inside deck also has some self directed panels that tells you about Seattle.  Yes, it is a little pricey and they try to sell you overpriced souvenirs, but it's worth getting in a long line for.  They now give you a free digital picture of you pasted in front of pre-selected, postcard-like views.  I thought that was fun since I got to pick the nighttime view even though it was bright out when I went.  My little Sleepless in Seattle moment :D"
"My experience was exactly like the other reviewers before me have raved about. Such friendly and helpful security and staff. They actually looked like they weren't miserable with existence, and wouldn't be brusque with any visitor, however hopeless and bumbling lol.  ,When you get a replacement ssc, make sure you fill out your info/ss# (don't worry about your parents' ss# and things). And don't forget your US passport/id, etc."
"This is the best ball-park in the majors.  Yankee Stadium has more history, but Fenway is old-school and they've really done a great job at updating it throughout the  years."
"Definitely a touristy thing to do. A little far from South Beach, but worth the cab drive (~$30), but if you have a car, even better. It was a nice relaxing time walking around the grounds and taking pictures. The garden is beautiful and provided lots of photo ops :)"
"This place is gorgeous inside and out. Awesome place for a private company party. Came here in 2000, will never forget that party ;)"
"One of my favorite memorials in DC. Love to visit here after dark (along with FDR Memorial).,Like the peaceful setting of this memorial by the Tidal Basin."
"The Jefferson Memorial - a rotundo that was magnificently built, it was pleasing just to look at it. We took a long walk around the water to get to the memorial. The statue of President Thomas Jefferson was fantastic we really enjoyed walking around this very renaissance architecture, so balanced and harmonious with the beautiful marble pillars all around. Really worth the walk to the memorial."
"The only way Fenway could get better would be (a) cup holders in the seats and (b) beer service. One thing I will never get enough of are their Monster Dogs!! They were such a find and I don't know if they make them anywhere else in the whole wide world, but they are SO totally worth the trip out to Yawkey Way. SO GOOD!"
"Honestly, one of my favorite places to visit when coming to Miami. You can spend the day at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens just strolling through the gorgeous gardens and enjoying the views of Biscayne bay. If you enjoy taking photos then you will also love all the architectural details all around and the strolling iguanas!,At my last visit I discovered one more reason to love Viscaya...the cafe! When my family got hungry I hesitated to go to the Museum cafe. I thought it would be the typical coffee and stale pizza kind of place BUT it is a full service gourmet cafe! We had burgers with sauteed mushrooms and gorgonzola with amazingly seasoned fries, salads with fresh perfectly grilled shrimp, butternut squash soup (delish), gelato and upside down pineapple cake with lattes and freshly made lemonade! Everything we tasted was just incredible! Honestly a very pleasant and unexpected surprise!!!,If you are in town, I highly recommend a visit here!"
Highly recommend visiting this mansion while in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area.  Great value for $18!  Great photo ops!  Amazing that this place was someone's winter home.
A beautiful baroque style mansion on Biscayne Bay with gorgeous interiors and gardens. The tour of the first floor was very informative. Visit the second floor and towers as well. The look down the tower spiral staircase was very cool. Keep an eye out for huge iguanas lounging on the property and in the waterways and funky vine entwined trees. Long lines on weekends. Go early in the day. Give two hours to enjoy the inside snd outside.
"I have lived in the DC area for 3 years and visited DC many times prior to that. Yet, I never stepped foot here until last weekend.,This is as good as it gets. The view is stunning, the history is rich and deep, and it is a great place to spend a nice sunny afternoon. The view of the Tidal Basin is spectacular, and you can see many famous landmarks from the base of the memorial such as the White House and the new MLK memorial. ,Parking can be a hassle, since it's limited to mostly street parking. You can park at the East Potomac park and at the golf course there too. I like to park on the street, even if it's far away, and enjoy the walk. Jefferson Memorial is also right next to the FDR and MLK memorials, and it's a nice walk to each along the basin."
A very nice dome with statue and engravings.  A free and impressive monument to his contributions.  No bathrooms that we saw.
"Nearby, there's paddle-boating on the river. Highly recommend! We had so much fun!"
"The poor Jefferson Memorial gets no love!  Why have all the memorials out on the mall, and then stick poor Mr. Jefferson, our third President, out in the docks?  Poor guy...  Well regardless, the view from the Jefferson is awesome, and who knows, maybe he liked his privacy and as such the location is fitting."
"Sure, the Space Needle is synonymous with Seattle. But, do you REALLY want to spend $18 a person to get to the top? If you really want to go up that badly, I would suggest splurging on lunch at Sky City (the restaurant in Space Needle). That way you can eat a delicious meal and go to the top of the Space Needle after your meal without the $18 elevator ride."
"If your visiting Seattle this is a must do and get ready to pay for the most expensive elevator ride of your life. There is no roller coasters up there... you can't bungee jump off the top... there is nothing ""exciting"" to do on top really. Just grab some coffee... grab your camera and enjoy the beautiful view of Seattle."
Located in Downtown Seattle this landmark is amazing. You get a great view of all of Seattle and it is a fundamental part of Seattle's history. If you ever visit Seattle this is a must visit because of the history and just the overall great experience you will have at the Space Needle.
This is obviously a touristy thing to do but on a clear sunny day this is a must if you have never been up there. Even on a Saturday afternoon it didn't feel crowded and the wait to go up was not very long.  The views are amazing.
"The view was something though its a long long line just to get in,  we are planning of eating here but after we saw the food, we changed our mind.  Hubby thought its still a fine dining but its just a regular deli now with cold sandwiches, nothing special.  The gift shop I bought alot of souvenirs only to find out that accross the street another gift shop are selling the same thing for halp the price, I was so mad considering how much I paid for the things I bought.,Anyway, it's still another good experience."
Great views on a clear day so try to plan a visit while it's clear.  We went early when the Needle opened so we beat the crowds.  Great 360 degree views!
"I love the picture you get to take with your party at the entrance.  I love the neat facts that are displayed as you enter the attraction.  I love how the elevator doode gives you interesting facts as you go up the elevator.  I LOVE the view of Seattle.  I love how it's an outdoor/indoor attraction.  I love how there's a cafe for snacks/beverages.  I love how there's indoor and outdoor seating.  I love how locals chill there to study and hang out (er... at least there were a bunch of college students and locals who were chilling the day w went.)  I love how there are guides who roam around the attraction and ask you if you have questions.  I love how they have mini exhibits of the different tall structures of the world.  I love the huge gift shop down stairs.  ,Okay, I know that I'm giving out a lot of loving, but I just finished writing my review for Sears Tower and the Space Needle blows it out of the water.  Seriously.  Soooo... 5 stars to the Space Needle! =]"
"Inline with the rest of the reviews...,-pretty much mandatory you visit the space needle at least once in your life if you're in Washington.,-carnie activities around the needle definitely degrade the experience of this famous landmark.,We ate dinner at the SkyCity restaurant at the top of the space needle...the view while eating there is 100% better than the view from the observatory.  Plus it's too windy to stay outside long and the view outside is osbtructed by safety cables.,Overpriced souvenirs, but that was expected."
"I have to say, being in the space needle is not what I expected it, but it was still worth it.,first saw the space needle, I thought it would be the best building ever. The building itself looked so cool! But I got shocked when I saw the price. 16 bucks to get on top has been WAY OVERPRICED. The shop below was great, though. ,The elevator took a long wait, but it was worth the wait. I really liked the flight up. It was liked going up a rocketship. When I reached the top, the observation deck looked small, and there wasn't much to do. The view was worth it. I got to see the whole Seattle. What was really great was that viewing the telescopes were FREE!!!! There's hardly anything but to sit and read the info inside. I thought the indoor exhibits were excellent. The food was also overpriced, but I'm not complaining. Think how hard it is to transport food from the bottom to the top of the space needle, then you'll understand.,Overall, this is a good attraction to be at, but go only once. Also, be sure to buy a souviner on the way out; it's worth it."
"I've been to the top of the John Hancock Bldg in Chicago and the Eiffel Tower in Paris so going to the top of the Space Needle was right up my alley (Empire State Bldg is next). ,It costs $18 ($16 with a military I.D.) to go to the top and that price includes a complimentary picture that will be put against a Space Needle backdrop. As you ride the elevator to the observation deck, you're given some very brief info about what you'll see when you get to the top. ,I go out to the observation deck and was very underwhelmed. I mean I was expecting to look down and all the people below to look like ants and not be able to distinguish people and places. I mean I could still see where we parked the car! Then I spot binoculars they have stationed all around the deck and I got all excited only to find out most of them didn't work or couldn't focus. Maintenance please?,Once you go back inside you can buy food, drinks, and enjoy the few interactive exhibits that give you a little more info about Seattle and the Space Needle. When you take the elevator back down of course it drops you off right in the gift shop, which of course was way overpriced. ,This being my first time in Seattle I had to come see this but I honestly wasn't impressed at all."
Very Expensive....The elevator ride is terrifying.....The restaurant...you would have to be a trump to find it reasonable.....the view is ok but you could find better on HWY 101 :) For Free
"Eh... *teetering hand back and forth*,I didn't pay the rediculous $16 to take an elevator ride, but I did look through the overpriced junk they sell in the store in the base.  ,I was excited to go to it when we went to Seattle, but I guess I don't know what I expected... Just lost all the excitement when we got there."
Absolutely a charming place to visit.  Pay to get into the mansion (outside gardens are free). Highly recommended it.
"Pas grand chose à voir, mais vaut le détour pour l'architecture étonnante de cet immeuble :)"
Everyone should go up ot least once in their adult life!
"My first trip to Seattle had to include a trip to the Space Needle.  Although, $18 for an elevator ride up 520 ft seemed a little pricey.  Lucky for them, I spent the dough and even splurged on a coffee all the way up at the top.  The view was breathtaking even with limited visiblity.  Quite chilly up at the top so make sure you bring a coat.  And if going up to the top wasn't enough, you can spend even more dough in the gift shop on your way out!"
"There are few other structural examples that quite capture the spirit of American optimism and bravado  from the mid-20th century like the Space Needle in Seattle.  I would argue it is in the top few of the most well-known monuments of any of the World's Fairs ever held.  Perfectly positioned it strikes a bold profile from whichever direction one chooses to view:  from Queen Anne Hill you have Mt. Rainier and downtown as the backdrop, from Cap Hill the Bay and the Olympic Mountains, from below the soaring arches up into the stars.  The impact of the Needle itself helped catalyze all of Seattle as we know it;  with visibility greatly enhanced businesses flocked to the area, pouring dollars and concrete to create this modern metropolis.  ,Our cities could benefit from more public structures such as this.  People need monuments and maypoles.  It helps bind us together.,Love it."
"Fenway Park is one of the oldest parks in MLB history.  If you love baseball and you see only one thing in Boston it is Fenway Park.  Now I know that we just won the World series in 2004 and it is hard to get tickets but there are other ways to see Fenway.  Take a tour.  Fenway Park offers tours on days that the team is on the road.  take advantage of this nice little perk.  Walk around the field, sit in the dugout or pretend to warm up in the bullpen.  Its great fun for all ages."
"Vizcaya is so beautiful and they have the BEST Halloween party. Be prepared to see tons of scantily clad ladies dressed like slutty nurses/cops/angels etc. ,I have also taken the tour and the docents are very knowledgeable about the place. ,If you are in Miami, DEFINITELY don't miss Vizcaya."
"We REALLY enjoyed our visit to Vizcaya. It was a nice change of pace after the noise and bustle of Miami Beach where we were staying. ,They are currently doing renovations on the interior courtyard so the ticket prices are discounted (I think its expected to go on through sept). You still get to see 90-95% of the house and all the gardens, so I wouldn't let this issue keep you from visiting. ,We arrived in the morning near opening which I would recommend, as we were leaving around 12:30 it was definitely getting more busy. The gardens are more enjoyable with less folks wandering around, and inside many of the rooms can only be seen through a narrow viewing door/window so you will end up waiting if it gets crowded. ,We did not realize there was an audio tour as the ticket booth didn't mention it, I think this would have been a nice addition to our tour. Also, a few of the side gardens could use a bit more maintenance (empty or stagnant water in the fountains/pools, things like that)."
"After coming from the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial was kind of a let down.  I mean, the statue seemed smaller.  Also, the air didn't seem as fresh."
"I dedicate my 150th review to you Fenway.  How to I love thee, let me count the ways...,1. I don't care that it costs me a month's rent to get tickets plus the food and beer,2. I don't care my ass hurts by the time the game is over, for you, it's worth it.,3. SWEEEEEEEEEEET CAROLINE!! BUMBUMBUM!!!!!!!!,4. Johnathan Papelbon.  My life is complete.,4a.  I got to sit on the Monster Seats and it was the best day of my life. It was worth every damn penny!,5. Those hot dog are freakin AMAZING. I don't care that they cost like $20.00 and you get 80 ketchup packets.,6. I sat in the rain for 2 and a half hours but it was freakin awesome.,7. I got to see Daisuke's first home game, and even though he looked like a fool, i will remember it for the rest of my life.,8. My mom's first game at Fenway the Red Sox lost 13-2 but my mom (and I) still loves them.,9. What other team and Park has an official rock band??,10. I don't care that you're falling apart and that your 1000 years old, NEVER CHANGE!! NEVER GO AWAY!!!,I love you Fenway, and I always will."
"This place is absolutely beautiful.  I was bummed it was raining the day i went, which kinda created small flooding outside in the garden.  The garden was beautifully manicured, there was marble statues outside, tea pavilian, the ""boat"" on the water..... We couldn't take pictures inside the mansion, but each bedroom was decorated differently, and there was a spacious courtyard in the middle.   $18 per adult."
"Maybe I'm just easily impressed? I've been going to Viscaya since I was a child and it is just as impressive every time. ,When I went on February 16th they were setting up for what looked like an very expensive gaudy wedding - a sight to see in its own right, but that wasn't supposed to be the entertainment. It was entertaining to see the gaudiest wedding on record, but the Viscaya property is just gorgeous and always the prime attraction to me. ,Pick a day with beautiful weather and go have a glass of wine in the orchid garden. If you don't find it impressive and beautiful, then I guess I really am just easily impressed.,If it was your wedding on February 16th, please disregard my comments and do not send Colombian hit men for me!"
Very nice memorial.  Park ranger was awesome and very knowledgeable.  Staff at stores could have cared less if anyone wanted or needed anything.. one didn't even get off the stole in the back room she made eye contact but never came out!
"Love this!  The statue is imposing and inspiring. There are some of his famous quotes inscribed on the walls on the inside, very patriotic and also inspiring. Amazing view of the cherry blossoms, water and Washington Monument. Also can see the Air Force Memorial in the distance.  This is my favorite memorial in DC. The only ""bad"" thing is its distance from the rest of the major memorials/museums but nonetheless A MUST SEE!"
"""I know your problem:  the Lincoln Memorial was too crowded.  No one ever comes to see me.  Frankly, I don't blame them.  I never did anything important.  JUST the Declaration of Independence, the Louisiana Purchase, the dumbwaiter...Wait!  Please don't go.  I get so lonely..."""
"So if you end up throwing a party at the Needle, here are the things you should know: ,If you plan to have a DJ, that DJ will have to bring ALL of his own stuff- including speakers, a microphone, everything. They only have a house system that pipes lame music throughout the space, so if you want to have a dance party, keep this in mind. ,The drinks are over-priced, so I recommend filling your flask. ,The party food isn't so bad, but buffet lines can get super long. ,Guests have free access to the observation deck, but only during the stated observation deck hours- not through the duration of your party. ,At the event I attended, the two bars were placed on either side of the elevator which guests entered from, which meant that everyone was packed in one room instead of spreading out. I'd re-think the layout for future events."
"Space Needle, you're pretty in the way you break up the Seattle skyline and extend it just a liiittttllleee further north than the rest of those downtown buildings. There are few things more comforting to me than you, jutting up against a blue, cloudless summer sky with the water in the background, or you shining brightly against the downtown skyline in the dark of night. You're a tourist trap, so I love you from afar. But I love seeing you; you always remind me that I am home.,So plus 5 stars for being a lovely reminder of how much I love this city, and minus one for ass-raping cost of a ride up the elevator."
"This is a landmark and a must see place.,It is very windy outside (so windy that it is not easy to hold the camera straight), and inside is causy and warm.,You go there, stay 10 minutes outside, 10-15 minutes inside, and finish visiting the landmark, and probably wont come back again as the city view wont change :)"
The Space Needle is useless but it doesn't get in my way and it helps me know which direction I'm headed.
"Guess what?  I'm in Seattle as a TOURIST.  So I'm totally down for doing the touristy things.  So let me brave my intense fear of heights and head up to the top of the Needle!,Again, definitely a better value if you use the CityPass (see my review of EMP/SFM). ,The view from the top is AMAZING.  Look in one direction and you see buildings!  The other direction - you see water!  And mountains!  It's really very breathtaking.  Be careful when you're up high...I lost my bearing and footing a couple times.  Heights make me a little light-headed and dizzy.,Plus, as me and my tourist boyfriend wander around town, we can get our bearings just by orienting ourselves with the Needle!  Not so necessary for the BF, since he has a good sense of direction.  But for me...all the clues and hints I can get are helpful!"
"Obligatory, and always nice to see a new city from up high. As far as really tall monuments go, though, it's not up there among the most interesting. I liked the gadgets inside that give you information as you walk around enjoying the view."
"I had the opportunity to visit the Sapce Needle this past week.  The view ...atmosphere and service in the Restaurant are AWESOME... however the food is way over priced and really extremely BLAND... no flavor what so ever.  They will put things on your plate that really doens't look all that appetizing nor does it taste appetizing.  I ordered the chicken, only ONE plate of chicken on the menu.... took 2 bites and put my fork and knife down.  It was not even worth it.  It's a shame because for the 2 of us our bill was $150 I believe.  The good thing is they did take the chicken off the bill still leaving it at about $90 for ONE person. The flatbread was the best part of the meal.  If you like tatsteful food... The Space Needle is NOT the place to eat.  So guys but they need a new menu or new Chefs."
"It's smaller than I thought, but what a great view. One of the places that's good for picture taking."
"I do agree that is is overpriced.  But it is a must-do when in Seattle for the first time and that is what the department of tourism is counting on.  Seattle is one of those cities that has tons of visitors and is an absolutely beautiful city.  Therefore, they will get their 19 bucks from a lot of people.  Went on a Friday.  It was raining, but who cares.  It's Seattle.  It was busy, but not overly. When we did finally get to the top (elevator ride is less than a minute), the views are stunning, even with the rain and clouds.  From the ball fields on the south side to the mountains to the west and everywhere else, you can't beat the views.  When you descend, you are dropped off at the gift shop, which of course is overpriced.  But being in the Seattle Center is awesome, with great places to eat and relax and other sites to see.  Seattle is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the World's Fair, so there is a lot going on regarding that.  Pony up the dough just this one time, then spend it elsewhere when you get back to Seattle.  And yes, you will be back."
One time visit definitely makes sense.. the coffee bar at the top is ridiculously expensive but has a good view of the downtown. was awful cold when I went there so couldnt do without a coffee
"I expected more for what I paid.  It's worth seeing once.  I've seen better for free at the Bonaventure in Los Angeles or the Empires States Building in NYC.  I don't fully understand the long lines for this attraction, I guess people just like riding elevators up and down for $15."
"Not worth it.,$16 pp for a 520' view of the place? Doesn't compare to the Hancock nor the Sears Tower - and to think this was built for the World Fair in '62 - SAD!! No wonder no one knows. ,It's surrounded by a sad, sad, sad, deserted, half-broken ""Fun Forest"", which is supposed to be a mini-carnival.  The views aren't spectacular, and the ""bar"" is nothing more than a convenient-store-type checkout line.     ,To top it off, we walked all the way here from Pike Street Market to pay $16.   Oh, the thought of it makes me want to cry."
"Very neat grounds, beautiful house with lots of details, nice garden views, and water views.  But... Lots of Mosquitos in the house and around the house and smelly sewage water.  Bring your bug repellent.  They badly need pest control and sewage/water cleanliness.  ,Glad I went once, won't go back."
Pretty good food. Nice experience.  But really expensive.
"Got dragged here with a friend from out of town. I've never been up the space needle even though I'm born in Seattle but eh he paid and up I went. I was quite shocked that it was so expensive about $18 per person. I think the cost was due to the summer season...anyway they offered a free polaroid picture before heading into the elevators but we kindly declined.,I was feeling a bit claustrophobic since so many people were crammed into the small elevator. Once we got up there it was a great view of the city. The weather was great that day, but with all the other tourists from out of town everywhere ruined a bit of the experience."
"It's a ""bucket list"" thing to do, just to say you experienced it. I went on a military discount which is $12. Regular price is $18. It's a bit pricey and can get boring fast. The views pretty cool, but I've seen better. I have heard it's a lot more worth it to go to the resteraunt in there."
"i certainly have a bias due to being from boston, but i actually grew up a cubs fan in the early to late 80's. ryne sandberg, sarge, jody davis, damon berryhill, andre dawson, shawon dunston....but that's beside the point.,my very first game was a doubleheader at fenway in 91 when i was 15. second game i saw a walkoff homer by wade boggs and there's still nothing like the passion these fans have, hence why i am one, too. i've since seen two more walk-offs:,ortiz against the angels against scott shields last september - wakefield pitched a complete game win, 3-2.,loretta against the mariners this patriot's day. ortiz two more home runs, and youkilis hustling out that single to lead to loretta's homer off guardado.,so tough calling between wrigley and fenway - easily the two most nostalgic and warm parks in the majors...."
"I was AMAZED by  Vizcaya! For me this place is such a gem and i was just wowed!! This huge mansion was owned by James Deering and decorated with a variety of European antiques.  I find it so unique all the pieces you find all in one mansion from different eras. And set in warm weather , sunny state Florida! While I was there and walked out to the gardens to take pics( Outside the mansion is the only place were u are able to take pics) I spotted a quinceanera and also a married couple taking pictures.,The Stone Barge and gardens were my favorites! Will def. go again on my next trip 2 Miami!! A++++++"
"The climb to the top is well worth it!  I was there on a hot, muggy summer day but the breeze through the open memorial was wonderful.  Very impressive statue of Jefferson commanding the room, with inspirational quotes around the perimeter.  Air conditioned gift shop downstairs.  Kind of a hike to get here from the National Mall, but worth it."
"Well I may be a little impartial, being a long time and fanatical supporter of the Red Sox [despite being a native and current New Yorker], but I'll try not to be. Everyone has to come here at least once in their life. It's a comprehensive sensory experience for everyone to enjoy. That's all I can really say. Everyone should visit Boston at least once, and while they're here, Fenway should be at the top of your list of places to go. As a matter of fact there isn't anything I wouldn't do for a big fat juicy Fenway Frank and ice cold draft beer right now. Swoon."
"This was my first visit to the Jefferson Memorial, and it was beautiful! My favorite is still the Lincoln Memorial, but the Jefferson was very scenic, and less hectic than the Lincoln. They also have a few designated parking areas that are more clearly marked, so it was easier to navigate. If you have time, I would highly recommend checking out the Jefferson Memorial."
"Visited here with my son and about 75 Boy Scouts on our way to the Boy Scout National Jamboree. ,Scouts spent quite a bit of time reading the inscriptions inside the memorial and I recommend that all Americans do the same."
"It's okay if you haven't been. Don't expect much. At about 500 feet high you get to see the city. $17 for an adult pass. A little steep for an elevator ride. Just before getting on the elevator, there's a photographer who takes your picture.  Take it. It's free. Go up to the top of the space needle, log in at a kiosk, and email the picture to yourself.  That's a nice perk. Don't spend too much time here. Just next door is the EMP Museum.  Spend time there."
"I'll be honest...,The Space Needle was not something I necessarily wanted to experience. I've never heard anything spectacular about it -- other than the view is cool and it's super windy at the top. But does it do anything? Does it spin? Does it go up and down? Is there lighting effects that make it scary? For $17, it better come with a drink and a hot dog!,The Space Needle did absolutely nothing thrilling for me. it was even suicide jumper safe. It almost felt like being confined in a small narrow space, 605 feet up in the air. There's not much to do but walk around against the wind and view the city. They have telescopes for spectators to gaze through -- if you want to look at the Chase Bank building across the way. ,I can see how this place would be AWEsome at night; the city lights might actually provide for a spectacular view...but who wants to be up there at night, freezing your tail off when you can go to a local bar and get completely loaded? Not me, mister. Not me. ,I suppose this was just a MUST SEE destination while out in Seattle...and now that i have seen it, been in it and around it...i am over it. ,There are much cooler touristy spots in Seattle, like the Sci-Fi Museum or the adjacent Experiment Music Project Museum -- both are located right by the Space Needle and are much more interesting and fun to see. ,Anyway, Space Needle..."
"This place is awesome, of course! It is a Seattle icon. I do have to mention though, when we were looking for places to have our wedding reception, we considered here. They were nice, and seemed capable. We were shocked at the bold carpet choices in the event space though. It was worse than any casino carpet I have ever seen. It wouldn't be easy to have any other color scheme going on. Basically, it was the carpet that led us to look elsewhere! It was a tough call, but it was seriously a strange choice for an event space. You have to see it to believe it. ,Other than that, the tourist parts of the Needle are perfectemente. I love going there at various times all throughout the year. I love the elevator operators. They are so crazy cool."
The Space Needle is a very popular destination in Seattle.  The needle offers a wonderful view of the city and the surrounding mountains (including Mt. Ranier if it is not clouded over).  It costs $19 per person to go up.  The lines are quite long but the wait time should not be more than 45 minutes or so.  A definite thing to see if you are visiting Seattle for the first time.  They also have a restaurant as well (Sky City) that you can go to that is located directly below the Observation Deck (I did not go there so I can not offer any opinions on the restaurant).
Fun! Wonderful views obviously. I would recommend the glass exhibit (If it is still there) A must see.
"I guess you have to go here if it's your first time to Seattle but...SO overpriced! $20 per person to ride up an elevator and get a view. If it's raining (which it usually is here), there isn't much of a view. There are so many obnoxious kids on field trips running around too. The interactive stations are kind of neat if you can get to them without a child stepping in front of you and hogging the machine. Three words: ONE TIME ONLY."
"I could give the Space Needle five stars or one star, but you still have to go.  If you're visiting Seattle, you can't get out of going.  It's impossible.  I'm fairly certain you need a ticket stub from the Space Needle to depart from Sea-Tac Airport.,As far as Really Tall Places With An Observation Deck go, this one is pretty good.  Everything is clean, there's plenty of information available on interactive displays and telescopes ring the outdoor walkway.  You can get a great view of the neighborhoods of Seattle, and take more pictures that your camera can hold.  That said, it's about $20 a person for the honor.  But again, the price doesn't matter since you're going anyway."
Space Needle... it's not even the tallest building in Seattle.  Need I say more.
"It's groovy to see from afar, but otherwise you may as well skip it. Just hype."
The view of the city makes this a must-see when traveling to Seattle.
"As a local and someone who has been lucky enough to see the gradual changes that have taken place in the restaurant, this is definitely a place to come and treat yourself. It used to be the home of the $20 cheeseburger, now however, the food is definitely much more locally focused with some gourmet flair, and the portion sizes are massive. It's still expensive, probably not worth everything they charge, but the views from both the restaurant and the observation deck are amazing, and the staff there are very helpful and informative.,All in all, if you're in Seattle, I think it's definitely something everyone should experience at least once, and if you can definitely go to the restaurant instead of just the observation deck. You'll spend much more, but you can enjoy the view from a cozy seat with a full belly."
"More like 3 1/2 stars, but it is worth doing on a clear day.  It's far from the tallest observation deck in the U.S., but in some ways that's a good thing.  Not being the tallest thing ever means you can actually see people walking around and see the downtown skyscrapers more at eye level instead of looking down on everything.  I agree that it's relatively overpriced, but it is worth doing at least once if you enjoy nice views of both the City of Seattle and the surrounding natural environment."
Pretty good for a one time visit.
"Beautiful grounds and preserved very well. I paid $5 extra to have a guided tour. The tour only included the first floor and did not go into the personal history of John Deering. It would have given more character to the building to include those details. Another thing i did not enjoy was how they had plexiglass above the gates that was keeping you from entering the rooms completely. I understand the gate, but there is not reason to make us look through plexiglass. The cafe  is nice. I asked our tour guide what it use to be and he said it was the bowling alley."
"Deserving an automatic five stars, the Space Needle will always be one of my greatest fascinations in structural design.      ,At the tender age of eight,  I first walked the platform deck during our first family vacation to Seattle.     I wasn't afraid of heights, so I loved overlooking at all the tall buildings of the city and watching the ships travel across the lake.     I was very a hyper kid, so would run from one part of the deck to another.    I got in trouble with my parents and the people that worked there because I was having so much fun running around to catch a glimpse of the Seattle view.    I was forced to settle down when my mother punished me and told me to go inside and behave.   But it was a short moment until I found the gift shop.    I begged my parents to buy me a model of the Space Needle.    All I got instead was a postcard to remember my experience there.      For years, I would add my thoughts of the Space Needle when conservation began with the city of Seattle.     I'm always recommending it to people.      ,Eighteen years later in the late summer of 1998, my friends and I visited the needle.   For me it was the second time and for some of my other friends - it was there first.      This time there was no running my behalf on the deck.   Just absorbing the cool breeze and remembering that feeling as a kid.     I found serenity again.   And that's why I returned to the needle in 2001 and just recently June 16, 2007.      I always find serenity and peace when i'm there.    This is my moment to embrace one of mankind's greatest creations:   the tall building from the ground, the 520 foot viewing of Seattle, the moving cars and people below, and the earth's creation - land, water, and sky.    My stress is removed for the moment as I absorb the 360 view.,Here's a funny thing deja vu last month at the needle.    I always thought I was going to propose to my future girlfriend at the needle.    Its been a dream that randomly appears in my sleep.   I can't explain it.   It just happens.     And when I find that very spot on the deck, I get chills.    Kinda freaky... but if it was meant to be.. well... we shall see.       ,I don't think I could stop reviewing the needle.   So I will pause right here for now.   I know i'm going to be visiting quite often. ,Notes:,Recent Admission Cost:  $16.00 per adult.,Bring a jacket even if its sunny.  Its very breezy up there."
"pros...on a beautifully clear day, which i hear is rare, you can see most if not all of seattle and surrounding mountains as well.  that was the case for me.  it was awesome.  even on not so good days you will get a bird's eye view of the city.  yeah it's a tourist trap, but a good one if you like to get a one of kind view of the city and if you like to take some pictures of it all.,cons...long lines, screaming children, and worse yet tired and complacent parents. these parents who won't take responsibility for their unruly children.  if you can'twon't control your children, you shouldn't take them out in public.  oh and parking sucks too, especially on a nice day like today."
"Every time I visit Seattle I always try to visit the Space Needle, the signature element of Seattle's skyline since the World's Fair of 1962. The sometimes fickle weather can dampen the experience, but on a clear day the views of Seattle and beyond are truly spectacular. Check out all the highrises and appreciate the vistas of the nature in Washington State. The Space Needle was designed by architect Victor Steinbrueck, with the office of John Graham and Company."
"Are you people joking?  Easy on the novel length reviews.  Fenway is what a baseball park should be like... the last thing baseball needs is more fair-weathered, mindless ""fans.""  Stay at home, the last thing this sport needs besides cheating juicers are retard fans.  Seriously"
Not alot to it but it is in a beautiful location.  Absolutely gorgeous.  It is out in the middle of nowhere so it takes a bit to get there but that only means that it is not very crowded.  Absolutely gorgeous though.
"there are just some things that should never, ever change. Fenway is at the top of that list for me."
"There's really not a lot to say but wow. ,I came here as a tourist, and it's funny because you see these monuments on television, and in movies and you think, WOW that's big. Then you see it in person and it's even more beautiful than you thought it would be. And way, way, WAY bigger!,A beautiful piece of American history that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime."
"If the Lincoln Memorial wasn't so famous I would imagine that people would find the Jefferson Memorial the most spectacular memorial in D.C. dedicated to one man. The steps alone to the platform with the dark statue against the light room, illuminated and surround by tall pillars and writing on the inner walls are just magnificent. ,The cherry blossoms that surround the monument are gorgeous, and if you want to see it in all of its glory I recommend going at night, the only thing that might spoil your time could possibly be a lot of tourists, to see the memorial solo would probably be a spectacular event, but is highly unlikely. While you're up there, check out the view, it's amazing."
"So we can say ""yes, we did the space needle"" ,Upon first arrival in Seattle, we saw it and I was like HUH?!?!? That's it??? Compared to the STRAT in Vegas, this thing is a midget. Come to find out last night, the Needle is actually half the size of the STRAT.   Well maybe you should charge HALF the price they do. I'm just saying. I get dizzy when up in the strat. the needle doesn't phase at all at a mere 60 stories. ,Oh well, it was fun nevertheless. Once up there, we really enjoyed the cam where you can chose a location, zoom in and pan around. We stayed indoors cuz out on the O-deck, it was cold as Alaska."
"A definite must do if you are visiting Seattle. Happen to come on a rainy day in Nov, so no lines and no wait. Staff was friendly and place was clean. There's a bar and cafe on the top. Tables for you to enjoy the view. One of my favorite parts was taking a photo (behind a green screen) on the way to the elevator and getting to the top to check out your photos and e-mailing them to you with different space needle back drops.,You walk around the top and get a marvelous panoramic view of the Seattle....hopefully it's just not too cloudy to see. Good for a one time visit, but don't feel the need to come back. If you're into fine dining there's a restaurant at the top that rotates or just grab a fun souvenir on the way out.,I've happened to visit the CNN tower in Toronto which is way taller and just a tad cooler...so I consider this more of a baby bro/sister to that. This wasn't a totally new experience because the sites are similar, but nonetheless this is still a wonderful engineering marvel."
This is Seattle's Landmark...no other architectural building says Seattle more than the Space Needle.   The view from the top is great...you can see almost to the Canadian border and all the mountains and buildings around.   The view of Puget Sound is pretty too.     This also gives you a nice bird's eye view of Seattle Center and all the museums and places around.
"Great view of the entire Seattle metro area. It did remind of the Sears tower, which is basically lots of rooftops of homes and buildings, but I still have no idea what I'm looking at! But hey, at least I got to say I've been there. Basically something you have to do in Seattle so you can say you did it and found out what all the hype is about (even though it is overrated).  I personally thought the view of the city skyline was the best on the Washington State Ferry sailing away from the city towards Bainsbridge. Now that is a view for the low low price of $6.70 (that you can see twice, once going away from Seattle to Bainsbridge and once going away from Bainsbridge towards Seattle). You also get incredible unobstructed views of Mt. Rainer. Hopefully you will be lucky to have great weather to see it. It was hard to catch Mr. Rainer when I was at the needle due to hazy weather."
"AVOID THE FOOD,Great views, but don't go to eat. The food is very expensive while the quality is very low. I ordered the a shellfish sample, the shrimp was overcooked, the Alaskan King Crab had no taste. The waiter was over the top obnoxious."
"Definitely worth the money. It maybe expensive to some, but the view is priceless."
"The view was beautiful.  We had a leisurely lunch and got to enjoy looking at the the whole 360.  Helicopters flew by at our height and below us and we got to watch the sea planes take off.  All in all a great do once event.,Lunch for 2 was $70 and the valet parking was $8 for 4 hours.,Being the geeks we are we also loved the Sci-Fi Museum!"
It's good enough to check it out from sea level. No need to waste money paying money going up the elevator.
Nice to see but not worth the price tag for me. Luckily there is a lot of other great parks and events in the nearby area.
"To keep it simple, if you are going to visit Seattle, you better visit the space needle. It is an icon of the city and a fun experiance going to the top of it. You really get a nice view of the city from here. There is a lot of info regarding the history of the space needle as well as some cool places to look through telescopes across the city. I very much enjoyed the time i spent all those feet above earth. Sadly i left Seattle the day they did the Angry Birds thing so I didnt get to see it. Anyhow I really had fun here, come check it out for your self, you cant help but be amazed."
"OVERPRICED! nice view. it feels like its moving when you're up there. CUURAZY! only do it once, please. u cant go to Seattle and not visit the SN!"
Where memories are made.
"I'm a fan because the experience was fun. ,I enjoyed an expensive dinner $55 for duck and my date had the sirloin for $50. Salad and soup is separate. Not cool.,The fun part was that we got to ride the elevator up and its all glass so you can see the whole city. Then the restaurant was rotating so as you sit at your table and look out the window you can see the whole city. It revolves slowly. You get to see the city 1.5 times during a whole dinner.  The service was excellent. The elevator attendant was cheerful. The receptionist at the Space Needle Gift Shop at the bottom was greeting happily too.,The other cool part was with the restaurant meal you get full access to the observatory."
"Amazing views and great atmosphere but the food was not impressive.  It was good, just not worth the cost.  I hope this improves because it's a blast to go up there and watch the city rotate."
"The views from atop on a clear and sunny day are beautiful - you can see across Elliott Bay, downtown Seattle, Lake Union, and if you are lucky, Mt. Rainier.  These views are not without a price though, and it is pricey.    It's fun to do at least once."
"Very beautiful house and gardens that Vizcaya has to offer! It's $18 normally for admission, which I think is pretty steep, but there are other discount offers that might help (such as AAA, tour book coupons, etc.).,You aren't allowed to take photos inside the mansion itself, though you will get to see 70 fully furnished and decorated rooms on two levels (plus the attic area). It was built over 100 years ago with these traditional Mediterranean architectural elements.,Photos are allowed outside in the grounds and gardens, When you step outside the mansion, my goodness, there is still so much to see. Directly in the back, there is a nice view of the ocean and other sculptures. So many nicely done sculptures (on their website, it says they restored about 180 of them from 2009 thru 2012), and the gardens are so beautiful and maintained well. Love their fountains as well. You could probably expect to spend at least 1-1/2 to 2 hours exploring everything Vizcaya has to offer. Certainly one of those must-see things on your list when visiting the Miami area."
"If you're in Seattle, you have to go."
"Wow... after living here for so long, I actually learned something about Seattle when I went to the observation deck.,Point 1 - it's not just for tourists anymore!,The view is spectacular. The day I went, it was unfortunately just cloudy enough that my cousin and I couldn't see Mt. Rainier or the Olympics, but it was still worth it.,Point 2 - I think the locals get more out of the view, because we know what everything is already and it's a great vantage point!,Loses a point because they pimp out all sorts of products on tourists. I know I know.... it's a tourist destination, why not cash in? Well, maybe have a ""local patron"" discount? And what's with Starbucks charging inflated prices, just because they're 500ft in the air? No thanks, I'll get a latte at one of the other 2 Starbucks that are also at the Seattle Center when I'm done.,Point 3 - it's not cheap, but it's not as expensive as the Sears Tower. (and I think it's a better view!)"
We had agreat time. It is worth the $18.00 for sure.
"I wasn't a big fan. Really nice views, but... I can't put my finger on it, just don't care for it. It's a peculiar structure."
"I'm with Natasha on this one for sure. No, I am not an angry Yankee's fan from New York (I like the Mets, if anything), but Fenway park has rarely been much except for a huge pain in my ass. It creates hordes of screaming drunken idiots who are always in my way whenever I'm trying to get somewhere in the area on a game day, and makes parking a complete impossibility in the area (which is an even bigger gripe, honestly, as I'm usually the passenger in a pissed off person's car who is screaming abut stupid Red Sox fans and how expensive parking is that night). I just wish they would move it somewhere further on the outskirts of town."
"One word: Amazing.  Jesse took me to my first Sox game and Fenway, and it was so fun.  It was a beautiful night, I dug the park, and I couldn't have gone with a better person.  I've only been to one other major league game, which was in Atlanta, and I had a much better time here.  The house was, of course, full, which isn't the case in Atlanta....it's partially because the stadium is MASSIVE.  Favorite part?  The group sing-a-longs.  We had amazing seats maybe ten rows back from third base, in between an older couple and a father and young son.  It was a great experience, and despite my less-than-stellar knowledge of baseball, I definitely would want to learn more and go see more games.  If you would have told me five years ago I'd be a Sox fan, I wouldn't have believed you.....it's happened."
"We went on a nice day so it was about an hour wait to the top and about a 45 minute wait to the bottom. It was really crowded and I had a problem with one of the staff member's attitude but the view is great from every side. There is a snack area and coffee stand that serves Starbucks as well as a beer and wine counter. It's the space needle, go at least once."
"If you've got children, or just become fascinated by big city skyline views, the Space Needle may be your cup of tea.  ,Personally, I've been there, done that in many cities around the globe.  So it was more about the ability to have at least checked it out than anything, for me."
A must see in Seattle!! Lucked out on a sunny day during my visit! Views were breath taking and getting up and down the space needle was very accessible despite the crowds! And enjoying some Seattle brew at the top was also a big plus!
"Overpriced,overpriced, overpriced,overpriced,overpriced,overpriced ,overpriced, overpriced,overpriced,overpriced,overpriced ,overpriced, overpriced........AND there are not even discounts for students, AAA members or seniors....the only discount is if you buy some special membership which does not seem remotely worth it unless you are a tour guide or something and then at that I think you only get to use it twice before they revoke the privilege.......,So they take you for as much as they can which makes me despise the management. Whatever happened to making tourist points accessible to tourists? I got to climb to the top of Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican free of charge and the view was better than this.....,That said....,This view was pretty good and most of the telescopes worked without much problem. The restaurant looked expensive though so I am glad we skipped it. ,One odd thing is that you can actually feel the tower swing when the wind picks up."
"This was so cool!  Was here 10/11/12, aerial view was amazing, clear beautiful afternoon!  Ate in the restaurant, clam chowder soup is best I've ever tasted!  Could've eaten 2 bowls, next time I will!"
"I agree with those who write that you have to do this if you go to Seattle. Besides, I was living in Seattle when the thing was built and I didn't go up. This was my first and last trip to the top.,We went up on a bright, sunny day. The view was great: high enough to see a long way but low enough to see detail.,All other aspects of our visit ranged from irritating to offensive. We waited in five lines to make the ascent: the first to activate the annual pass that we purchased online at a drastic discount, less than the price of a pair of tickets; the second to clear security; the third to be asked if we wanted our photos taken; the fourth to wait for the wait to get on an elevator; and the fifth to actually wait for an elevator. Those five lines could have been reduced to three: buy the ticket, clear security and line up for the elevator. The Space Needle is obviously a key player in Seattle's college student full employment legislation.,At the top, we waited in another long line for the ""free"" drinks that were included with our pass. They were worth everything we paid for them. Finally, after a circuit of the observation platform, crowded with families and kids, we waited in yet another long line, through three elevator cycles, to get down."
I hate heights but I always love going to landmarks like this.  I still can't decide if I like these elevators or not.  I expected to be able to see out of them like the Eiffel Tower but they are closed.  It made me a little bit claustrophobic but it was a short trip.  I also have to say it is very well maintained!  I wish we could have seen it at night and if I ever go back I'll definitely see about going at night because the sun makes it hard to see!
"This is another one of those reviews where I think everyone who's already written is right.,If you're visiting Seattle, you have to go TO the Space Needle, because there's a lot of cool stuff in the park around it and an interesting neighborhood (Queen Anne) directly north of it.,But going up to the top is an overpriced waste of money when you can do 2 things for free instead: (1) admire its exterior from various vantage points in the park, and (2) take a 15-minute walk to Kerry Park in Queen Anne and get a view that's just as good as that from the top, and actually BETTER because it includes the Space Needle.,Seattle is a great tourist town, but the Space Needle elevator ride is totally skippable."
"Amazing view. Terrible lines. Yes, it is touristy and a ""must do"" type of thing but the lines can get quite long. We were supposed to go up and have dinner but we ran out of time so we did the normal tourist thing. I recommend going to a nice dinner there (reservations are almost necessary) and the ride is free. Plus, I doubt you have to wait in that stupid long line."
"It's a tourist attraction. You have to go at least once, and there are some nice things in the gift shop....not very many....but some. The year pass isn't that expensive if you plan to take family/friends from out of town."
"When I first moved to Seattle, I was a poor student and only ate in nice restaurants when my parents visited.  It was their idea to eat at the Space Needle, and I was horribly disappointed.  ,Some years later, though, they returned for another visit, and my always enthusiastic mother insisted on another trip.  It was like I was in a completely different restaurant.  The service was far better, the food was excellent, and much of the cheesiness was gone.  I now go probably once a year, and it's always been up to par, though the price is a bit high."
It's okay...YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE VIEW! YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE VIEW! let me say it again....YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE VIEW!!!!
"Lets just say keep it in the skyline and don't go in !!!!!!!!!!!! We had reservations ( My Pregnant wife 4yr old daughter and 6 yr old son ) and got there a little early ,so we walked around observation deck for 3-5 min when my 4yr old daughter who is potty trained had a accident . We didn't have any change of clothing for her and didn't want her to sit in pee so I picked her up,put my coat around her and held her tight to hide her accident from any one ( she war embarrassed ). I went in and told the older lady ( in charge ) at the counter. I need to cancel are reservations .First thing from her mouth is ""You need to pay for your observation deck time"" I said I'm not worried about that and will pay down stairs . The next thing you know this lady hold up are elevator for 1-2 minutes ,rides down and when the door opens at the bottom she quickly gets 5 steps out ,turns and says (as she points ) there they are .. and two wanna be cops approach me (with my daughter in arms and grabs me and says ""you all have to pay for your trip up"". I said quietly get your F%^$ hands off me . and they followed me to the pay area where I vented to the nice guy at the booth who would not let me pay and apologized for someone way above his pay grade treated us and the old guy and fat guy behind me trying to act tough to a family of 4 ....OK ...... Maybe overprotective Dad that didn't want to tell all in front of daughter she wet her pants . But Rude older lady didn't give me a chance to explain............Really sad every time I see the needle I remember This story .... . View was cool ..."
"Beautiful view of my favorite city. I live here and I can't believe I've never been. I had to fall in love with an amazing woman from Texas to finally get me up here. Thank you Des, I love you!"
"Did you know they have cameras at the top that you can control from kiosks on the observation deck, and said cameras have frightening zoom capabilities? For the voyeuristic, I suppose that makes the $18 elevator ride a little easier to swallow. On the other hand, your fancy condo with beautiful view of the space needle might be a bit less appetizing now."
The space needle give you an amazing view of the city and is a beautiful place to be for watching sunsets or a romantic evening out!  I have been up the space needle 3 or 4 times now and each time was an amazing experience!
"I recommend coming near sunset.,Overpriced, overrated and a definite tourist magnet. But it is all worth it if you're a photographer.,I was really hesitant on even paying more than $5 to ride an elevator to the top, but I caved in. Can i really go back to Long Beach and tell people that I didn't visit the space needle?,Paying the arm and leg, I entered the top structure and immediately reached for my SLR. With a telephoto lens, this is literally a photographer's zone. Great capture of the city with a view that not everyone can see = great.,Again, overpriced, but if you go near sunset or at night, it is worth it."
"The greatest baseball park ever!  I'm originally from the San Francisco area, so I'm used to the huge stadiums where you bring your binoculars out of habit since 90% of the stadium's view is of ants running around on a big green field.  My boyfriend and I had nosebleed seats and we felt extremely close to the game.  It was amazing.  The seats are uncomfortable, but worth it.  The fans are great people to be around!  They make the game so fun!  When I was there, the wave made it around the whole stadium at least 5 times, I think it made it around 6 or 7.  For those living in Boston, Fenway is not experience that should be missed!"
"Cool views, nice experience, friendly staff. The locals were right tho, for less money and waiting in line a whole lot less, We could have just gone to Seattle's tallest building, had the same gorgeous sights, including the Needle! Still a cool place, went on Christmas day, I thought it was cool they were open."
"I'm a sucker for tall buildings and their observation decks. If a city has a really tall building, you can bet your life savings that Jamie Quilon will be putting it on his list of things to do while in that city.,Seattle is no different. The Space Needle is such an iconic structure and Seattle is such a beautiful city, how can I not go to the top of the thing? I paid the $18 charge without even blinking.,The view from the top is amazing. Seattle is such an amazing city and from up there, you can see all of it's splendor. There are little placards located around the whole observation deck that lets you know what you are looking at, so that's a nice touch. There is also an informative timeline located inside letting you know the history of the structure."
"I'm terrified of heights!! On a recent gals weekend trip my daughter and bff convinced me to go up to the top of the Space Needle.  I was pretty nervous and just didn't look out when the (glass) elevator was going up. Good thing it's only a 41 second ride up to the top. Once the door opened up and I saw the beautiful view (it was a gorgeous sunny day!) I was not so nervous. I walked around and we ended up having some local wine, walking around and mingling with others. The views were amazing. We went outside for a photo op, which made me very nervous so I went back in as soon as we got our pictures. lol We hung out for probably about an hour then went back down the elevator where of course it leads you to the gift shop. There are a lot of neat little souvenirs. My advice to people afraid of heights, go for it. It's not as scary as you think. :)"
"It's the Space Needle.  It's expensive and silly.  Go once.  If you've got the dough, go have dinner there."
How does the space needle only have one review?? Amazing view all around
"I had my wedding reception at the Space Needle. It was supposed to be in the Seattle room but at the last minute Kenneth Graff - our Space Needle liaison - changed it to the Puget Sound room. During our last meeting he offered to upgrade us to the Puget Sound room for a nominal fee but we told him that we liked the Seattle room and wanted to keep our reservation the same. When we stepped into our reception, we were in the Puget Sound room and didn't have the catering details we had discussed, like the cocktail server and the drink selections (two major surprises). Kenneth hadn't communicated those details to our captain so the first few minutes were confusing, trying to let her know what had been discussed at our planning meeting with Kenneth and what changes needed to be implemented so they would align with our contract. There were other more minor details that were different, like how our guests had to wait to use the regular elevator (Kenneth told us they would be allowed to use the private elevator so they wouldn't have to wait in line - for upwards of 30 minutes) and we said that we would bring in our own projector and did, but one was set up and was to be charged to us. ,Aside from the details mentioned above, we had a wonderful reception. The catered food was absolutely delicious and watching the sunset from the room was quite memorable and beautiful."
"My Bf surprised me for my Birthday and it was an amazing night.,We were a little bit early so they took us to the observation deck and gave us a buzzer. It was a bit packed but still beautiful. Whent he buzzer went off, we went downstairs to be seated for dinner. Unfortunately, we were not seated by the window, and they said the place wasn't packed... either way, still a beautiful view. The resturant spins slowly, so we had to rearrange ourselves to make sure we were moving forwards. I was feeling a little sick from the movement, but it wasn't horrible. The waitress was really nice and very honest. She was acurate with everything she suggested.,We ordered the crab cakes as an appitizer. Everything on that plate was delicious. We then ordered the shortribs, and the seafood fettucine. Both were yummy. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of seafood that came out on my place. The scallops were amazingly sweet. I was happy and got full very fast! I also got a yummy italian soda. For dessert, the waitress allowed me to get my sorbets on this smoking dish with candles. That was very nice of her. :),It was pricey, but that what we expected. ,I would definately go back to eat there for my next celebration. But I will take some motion sickness drugs first.  :)"
"THE GOOD:,Awesome views on clear days (Besides being Iconic Seattle),THE BAD:,Expensive & often crowded,THE LOWDOWN:,It is the tourist thing to do, so all of our guests usually go here, even if we don't go up with them due to the cost.  However, this year we picked up the annual pass.  It pays for itself if you go at least 3 times.  So being that we live here and we like to have friends come and visit, we will get good use out of it.  (We'll see),Bottom line: when its not crowded it is awesome, but you need to know when those times are."
"At night under a full moon, spending time eating with loved one's at the Restaurant above. Once in a life time dreams."
"So if you live here and you've never been and you have people in your life who want to know what you want for your birthday because you're so hard to shop for? ,Ask them to bring you here for dinner. Go early--say 5:00. ,Stay for a long time--club soda is free---you can get free booze at all those bars down below that give free booze on your birthday.,The food has gotten better--last time I was here it was atrocious. Anyway you're here for the view, not the food.,It's not the kind of place you have to go every 6 months or a yr--more like once every 10 yrs (seriously) So if it's been that long, call in some favors and get someone to take you! Even on a cloudy day, it's really breathtaking.,If you are from out of town, make a rez and get up there! It's really worth it..."
"I visited the Needle this last labor day weekend, as part of my touristy duties while in Seattle. Definitely a ""see it once just to experience it"" type of place. Views from the top are spectacular and they have free telescopes and binoculars so you can scope out your car being dinged in the parking lot below, or some drunken boaters out on the water. When heading up, be the last ones into the elevator so you're pressed against the glass which feels like it's going to fall out while you make the ascent. Most memorable moment, after said elevator ride, my wife's cousin looks at me and with a totally serious face, said: ""Dude man, my nuts are hella tingling."" Haha, wtf!"
"Unless I met a man and was having a super romantic date..I probably would never go up on the needle ever again.  Also, I don't live in Seattle..so the chances of an outing here are rather slim =).  Of our 3 days in Seattle: days 1 and 2 ""wow!!  LOOK SPACE NEEDLE!! WE MUST GO!""..ok day 3 comes..up we go...10 minutes later I was so sick...not from heights but just dining at the restaurant and the entire circle action going on everywhere..where during the gift shop journey I had to bee line to the exit and sit there to wait for the others.  It's one of those things that was more impressive in pictures than in real life.. kinda like the Statute of Liberty...I was very very disappointed.  I wish to visit the Eiffel Tower in the next few years...I hope I don't get the same kind of let down =(.  I think the Space Needle is better from the bottom up..the view is impressive yes, you get to view the Seattle skyline..but it's just any other skyline.  If you want to see it..I took a few panoramic shots..message me..I can send them to you and it may save you some valuable time."
"Stay to the middle!,I tried to walk to the edge and got sick.  I'm not really afraid of heights but there is a slight decline the closer I get to the window.  ,The store was in the middle so you know I loved it madly!  I wanted to sit at the restaurant and drink and enjoy the view but it was too crowded.  ,The view was amazing.  I especially liked the view of Puget Sound.  I often wonder why my family left such a wonderful place.  I was 3.  And JPL offered my dad a package equivalent to Boeing.  Such a dilema.  But here we are."
"It's awesome for about 10 minutes. Then you realize you spent a boat load of money for a view you could get at tall hotel. I guess it's one of the things you gotta experience, even if it sucks."
"Go at sunset/twilight.  It is beautiful.  Expensive, yes, but beautiful.,I agree with those who say that you should eat at the restaraunt; however, you need to get reservations ahead of time (at least if you are there in the summer).  We tried to get in on a Sunday night and then again on Monday afternoon and they were booked.,I'm glad I did it, doubly glad that I did it at twilight.  The photos I took were amazing, and I can't imagine that they would be as good during the day.  ,Will I do it again?  Probably not, but it was definitely worth doing at least once."
"Ok, soo I just moved to Seattle, and ever since I got here, I wanted to go up and see the view from the space needle. I had just come back from Fremont and the view from the bridge were the Troll is was awesome. Soo when I paid $18 to go up the space needle and see the view, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. It's a really nice place to go, and definitely something you cant miss if your in Seattle, but its not really the most awesome thing. The ride on the elevators are short and crowded and theres really nothing up in the observation deck but coffee."
$18 to see a view.... SKip this
"It was a bit pricey, $18 to go up to the Space Needle but I didn't mind doing it cuz I was a tourist, I wouldn't have done it for that price if I was originally from there.  We went late in the mid afternoon so there was no line to wait in.  We seen the gorgeous view of the city as the sun was setting and took amazing pictures.  It is also very cold and windy up there so make sure you have a jacket with you. Also, walk all the way around the needle to get the entire view of the city at different angles. Its always fun to look for familiar places such as Kerry Park and the EMP!  One thing that definitely surprised me was that they served Starbucks coffee at the coffee shop on the top which adds a nice touch to the place because it gets cold up there."
"Great experience after dusk! We went up at around 8pm on a weekday and there was no line to speak of and the view of downtown is amazing. There was enough room on the observation deck for my husband and I to maneuver the SLR on a tri-pod. The restaurant does not offer any vegetarian or hardly any non-sea food dishes on the menu. We initially wanted to have dinner, but ended up going to Nordstrom cafe and going here after for the night views, which was worth it."
"This was so cool at the top of the Needle.  Awesome views of the city, and surrounding areas.  $20 to go to the top and so worth it.  There is a restaurant on the top which is rather cheap surprisingly, and the elevator ride to the top was amazing.  The shop on the lobby floor is really amazing.  Huge gift shop with lots of seattle stuff and surprisingly its one of the cheapest to buy souveniers.  The only thing I didnt like is the line for the elevator to get to the top is really long.  Waited almost an hour and we went during the week.  I can imagine on the weekends."
good view and food was out standing.
"Architecturally, this is a monumentally inefficient building. There's more steel underground to support the needle than there is above ground.,As an attraction of Seattle? I thought it was great.,Yes, it's $18 a person. It's pricey. However, if you go on a clear day it has some AWESOME views. We saw Mount Rainier and got a better view of several of the mountain ranges (as well as the city itself) from the needle. It also has an interesting history (build for the World's Fair and all).,This is something that's good to do one time, on a clear day. I don't see myself returning for a second round of Space Needle, but I did enjoy it while we were up there."
"Expensive and getting dated.  But if you are in Seattle, you've got to go here.  Plan a 1/2 day around it.  When we were there the lines were long and so was the wait.  Space needle was selling tickets for a ride up 2 and a half hours later.  We bought VIP passes (paid double fare) and rode up within 15 min.  So do VIP if money does not matter to you and if you are in a hurry to get to the top."
"What is it with iconic phallic-shaped structures in different cities that cost an arm and a leg for a quick elevator ride up to the top? Well, we had just finished walking around Pike Place and figured hey why not knock out two touristy things in one day. So we walked over to the Space Needle, and with the structure peering over the clear blue sky that day, all I could think about was Tomorrowland in Disneyland. And I also craved a Mickey Mouse ice cream bar. Not sure why.,So after a $2 off coupon (hey, one more dollar and it's a piroshky!) I cut out from one of those Seattle tourist attractions booklets, we made our way up to the top. I'd like to say the view was spectacular, but what made the skyline ""pop"" was that we gradually got to see the sun go down. Since we didn't have a Seattle local with us, we didn't know what buildings were what. But it was cool to see Mt. Rainier in the background, with it's white snowcaps. Once night time fell, I was freezing my butt off out there. All in all, I'm glad we visited the Space Needle. Once, just once."
"If you've never been go to say you've been. ,If you've been to Stratosphere in Las Vegas then you're not missing out on much if you decide not to see the Space Needle.,It's cool to see Seattle from that point."
"Yup...it's that good....,View -- 5 stars,Service -- 5 stars,Food --5 stars (for taste, presentation, and creativity),So don't be scare away by the price you see at ground zero.,We thought the price was just the ordinary touristy price you have to pay when you visit a landmark. Or like some places where the view / hype usually adds 30% to the bill. ,Sky City is my friends, a combo deal. ,Since we didn't have a reservation or belong to the Simpson family, we had to wait at the first floor for 15 mins, and then another 15 mins at the Observation deck. ,Time flew by at the observation deck because we get to walk around to see the view with different telescopes and computer gadgets. ,What we ordered: ,Seafood Platter - Oyster with caviar, crab, shrimp, king crab legs.,Tiramisu ,Sky City Sundae - great presentation.,What else I would order if I had a second stomach: The Mahi Mahi or Filet Mignon."
"Great views, especially on a clear day. Super touristy - you won't find many locals going to the space needle on a given weekend. But you gotta do it once. Or be forced  into the $18 elevator ride by a visiting out-of-towner"
"This is a great way to see the Seattle skyline. Yes, the food is expensive but when you factor in the cost of the normal (no dining) ticket to the observation deck, it is worth it. We spent 1.5 hours eating a good meal, having a beverage and watching the wonderful Seattle skyline glide by. Afterwards, we walked up to the observation deck for more viewing but honestly, we did not spend much time there as we were able to see everything from the dining room. A great, relaxed way to see the Seattle skyline with no lines or crowds.  Food was above average and service was excellent (we were in no rush - with the view, why?)."
"Not awful, wanted to give two and a half stars because I want to respect that the Space Needle is a good part of the tourist economy in Seattle. That being said, I've been in more impressive structures there are meant for overlooking cities. I've been blessed to check out the view from Auckland's Sky Tower which beats this by a mile stone. If you've never viewed a city from a high distance before, I think you'd enjoy it but for me it was an okay experience."
"Loved the Filet!  Great vibe, great food, great service!"
Loved it!
"The restaurant is insanely not worth it. When I was there and went to the top as a kid it was pricey so it's probably even more expensive now. That said, the Space Needle is my favorite manmade landmark in the world. Just absolutely beautiful with an amazing view and I probably think about it as often as any Seattle native."
The 3 stars are strictly for the view alone. It was amazing until I ended up getting woozy and wanted to die [likely due to my crunkfest the night prior].  I had a $30 Shrimp Louie Salad that tasted like water with Thousand Island dressing poured on top and the picture taking lady's voice is still shrieking in my head.
"A few days a go the wether was so sunny and nice and the sky was amazingly clear. Me and my best friend went to space needle and honestly the view from the top is more than just amazing! Its stunning! You cannot leave this place is so unreal! ,This is probably the best tourist adventure a foreigner can have in Seattle!!!!"
"My wife and I were only in Seattle for a few days in April 2011. Spring showers were quite rampant - freezing rain and sleet even fell...but nothing was going to stop us from traversing to the pinnacle of panoramic views. As we ascended to the top, the winds seemed to settle enough that we were able to take unobstructed, scenic photos. All in all, majestic 360 degree view."
"This place is a giant tourist trap. Come on - it's not even that tall! Unless you enjoy waiting in line for an hour to get on, 15 minutes on the top, one more hour in line to get down, skip this."
"this is deffinately one of those thins you go to just to say you have gone to,expensive to go up; like $18 per person just to ride an elevator! and all you get is a free picture..and no that picture isnt even printed or developed, its electronically mailed to you!,then you go up, and its not that big going all around...crowds of people squished together trying to go outside, back inside, sitting here, looking there,,and make your go around for views of houses one view, boats, then a shipyard, then the pier and ferris wheel at a distance,not worth it to go again"
"I worked here for a short time, and have to admit that I didn't have to pay to see the great view. However, I must say, the view IS fantastic. You'll also find that most of the employees have a lot of knowledge on the area. If you want to know more about something or find something to do, there will probably someone who can help you out.,I do have one specific recommendation though. **This might gross you out.** As a worker I found that when people vomited, it was generally from the Restaurant, and they were generally eating crab or seafood. If you have a weak stomach, don't eat seafood in a spinning restaurant. Makes for a bad combo.,I do think it's a neat place to be even on stormy and rainy days. When the winds are blowing between 50 and 60 mph, you feel like you're walking on the deck of a sailboat. Once again, stay away from the seafood on those days."
"I'm glad I went up to the top despite the $16 entrance fee.  It gives you a spectacular 360 degree view of Seattle.  We came on a Sunday at noon and the wait was only 20 minutes.  Once we got up there, we found it refreshing that it wasn't cramped and crowded like other experiences I've had (ie. The Empire State Building & The Eiffel Tower).,We easily made our way outside and could easily catch views from every direction.  The space needle is definitely worth coming to at least once in your life.,If you want to eat at the restaurant make sure you make reservations in advance.  It's also really pricey - $20-50... yikes!  After one look at the menu we shook our heads and walked away."
"Thanks to the 1962 World Fair, Seattle's city line will forever be unique with the Space Needle"
"I suppose you have to do it once. And then never again! ,You either pay $16 for an elevator ride and to look at the view, or you spend a shit load of money eating at the restaurant and feeling like you got a good deal because you would have spent $16 for nothing.,I've never eaten at the restaurant. So my rating is based on paying $16 for looking at the view.,Cross that off the list."
"Visited Seattle and wanted to get the full tourist experience buy goin up to the top of the Space Needle.  While it was cool to get a view of the city from up above, i think it was ridiculously overpriced.  $38 for 2 adults to go to the top and just look around.  ,Wont be doin that again."
"Sometimes you just have to go and do the standard tourist stops and this is in the list. 360 degree views and a reasonable wait time for elevator travel. While up there do go to the restaurant. Mind you there is a minimum purchase if $35.00 per person. I had the Kobe beef steak ""vegetable were ok"" which was medium rare and was so good that it didn't need any A1. Had the lunar orbiter desert which is a good show presentation but at the end of the day is just a fancy scoop of ice cream."
"A nice view on a clear day, but so pricey at $23! And crowded. Do your other tourist must-dos first (e.g., the underground tour). Prepare to wait on summer weekends. Not a kitschy experience once inside--just a nice view. Picture a classy hotel lobby packed to the gills with children."
"If you're a local, wait until they tweet their annual pass special...it's usually the cost of one ride and you can ride all year...ditto for the rest of the five star comments.  It's the real deal."
"Nice presentation, not too expensive... Good stuff, nuff said"
"When I registered for a training, the confirmation email revealed the training address as the Space Needle. I figured that it was just a catch-all location and my seminar would end up being in some faceless reception facility somewhere outside of the actual Space Needle. But I was wrong. I showed up when the building's doors were still locked, and flagged down an employee whom I expected to politely steer me in the right direction of the training site. Instead, I was invited to take the elevator up. ,There's no concise way to describe the sensation that occurs when you get to take an elevator up to a very tall height, and the elevator happens to be glass on one side so you can see just how high above everything you travel. As you're safely suspended in a fish tank far above the world where you usually are and where everyone else still is, maybe this feeling inspires dread or fear or nausea. If you're me, its closest relative is freedom. The only thing that rivals this whoosh on the insides is the elevator trip back down to earth.,My review is biased, since by virtue of my training stub, I was granted access to the top of the Space Needle free of charge. The adult admittance fee of $16 seems a bit steep, but it likely won't once you get to the top and that whole 360 view as your compensation. Sure, my employer had to pay for the training, but there's no price you wouldn't pay for freedom, right? Thanks, work. ,Finally, I find it very hard not to love a city when you get to see a city from a very lofty vantage point. It's why Portland always looks good from the grounds outside the Pittock Mansion, and why San Francisco is so hard to resist from on top of Twin Peaks. I drove the four hours north from P-Town for work, took a ride on an elevator, and ended up falling in love with Seattle. I guess the moral of this story is if you want to win me over in no uncertain form, get me high."
"I hope she remembers....  cuz I'm not sure that there are many clear days in seattle ;)  just kidding....,either way... it's probably been 25 years since I've been up this thing.. and along with the cityscape being different... I don't remember much of being up in the needle either.,Looked like they have done some cool things to modernize...  and it wasn't too busy when we were there so the little girl got to run around a bit.,a very unique place...  can go right next to Big Ben on her list of buildings she recognizes.,maybe I'll go in 30 years when she has a little one of her own too!"
I'm a fan of these views. The fact that this had a rotating restaurant in it (my first) made it even more existing for me. Even though it wasn't really necessary I rode the SkyTrain here from my hotel just to add to/complete the experience. We had made dinner reservations ahead of time and after checking in were directed towards the lift queue. After a quick ride to the top we were seated in a window seat which really excited me as I was able to take pictures throughout dinner as we slowly spun around. It was still well light when we were eating and the view was far reaching. The waitress took our picture for us as well. After dinner we went to the observation deck for a brief time before getting back on the SkyTrain. Often times restaurants in these key locations slack off knowing they will get business anyways; I did not feel that was the case here. The food and service were great. I would definitely return again if I lived locally; there is no reason why this is just a thing for tourists.
"The view is nice, but the fact that they dare charge you $17 for an elevator ride to the top is ridiculous and not worth it at all.  I suppose if you're eating in the restaurant it's nice, but if you're just going to the top it's a very cheap, tourist trap type experience.,Since it's a Seattle landmark, you almost have to do it -  they're basically holding tourists hostage with these prices."
"Nice view of Seattle from here but that's about it.  Hey, it's basically an observation deck to see the city.  The one plus with this is that you can get the City Pass and see this plus other major attractions in Seattle."
"New to Seattle, then this is a must see. But only if your have a nice camera to take photo's. You are paying $19 to go up. Or else you can pay $26 to go twice (day and night). Cuz if you use a cell phone camera, I don't think it's even worth it going up. If you want to eat at their restaurant, make sure to make reservations at least two days in advance on-line to get the times you want, and make sure you state window seats. Or if you would like a romantic date, check out when the sun sets...That way, your admission here will be worth it."
"i think that the space needle is over rated. it was expensive, $62 for hubby and myself. the wait on a wednesday late morning was almost an hour. unfortunately, it happened to be an overcast and cloudy so mt rainier was not visible. but more than that, there weren't any markers set around identifying landmarks. like other tall viewing platforms have. perhaps there aren't any notable landmarks?"
"Hey Ho!  Need a high place to go?,Well, rising out above the fray is the World Fair icon, the Space Needle.  Why am I spending time and money to go up this thing? (yeah, it is a little on the pricey side)  Um, because it's there, and I can't resist going up towers / tall buildings.,So what can tell you about the Space Needle?  First, there are two options: The Observation Deck (O Deck) and the revolving restaurant, the City View Restaurant.  I didn't go to the restaurant, so all I can tell you is that it spins, giving you a full city view while you eat, and that you get to ride up for free when you dine there.,So the O Deck - first helpful hint - don't wait in line, use that nice self service kiosk to the right of the ticket line that no one is using.  Use your credit card and out come the tickets - you weren't planning on paying cash anyway, were you?,So around to the left is entrance, where they are including a free digital picture as part of you O Deck entrance fee - yeah, that's right, a free green screen, we'll put your face on the city backdrop with the Space Needle in it.  So you say, hey Glen, don't you have to buy one of those 8x10's, a keychain, or a mug with it?  Nope - of course, they are more than happy to sell you that kind of stuff, but you take your receipt, scan it in, and you can email the picture to yourself, your mom, and your ""best"" friend that you want to make jealous of the fact that you're in Seattle, and not them.,So up the elevator, 520 feet you go.  The front is clear so you can catch the views as you go up.  And it goes up pretty fast, well under a min.  The elevator guy barely has time go through his spiel.,You exit out and can enjoy the views from comfort of the O Deck, or go outside for the fresh air.  Inside, there are informational kiosks, interactive displays telling you of the history of the Space Needle, as well as information on the surrounding area.  There is some snacks and drinks available as well.,Outside, enjoy the view and the fresh air.  Given that we are in Seattle, it is a bit cold up there, so be prepared.  Wires keep you from standing on the saucer deck for better pictures, but at least you don't have to take pictures behind some dirty, scratched up plexiglass.  The ring extends out a bit, so you can get some clear shots of the scenery if you put the camera up a bit, but you won't get a clear shot of anything directly below (sad news for those trying to get a clear picture of the Frank Gehry EMP building).,Props to the Space Needle for providing GRATIS viewing scopes.  You know the ones I'm talking about - ususally, you have to put a quarter or fifty cents into it to look for about 30 seconds, and of course, you can't tell if it is even worth it until you put the money in.  Well here, there are many stationed all around the deck, and they are all FREE!,As you go back down to the ground floor, it conveniently takes you to the gift shop, which you all expect, but that is where you can go pick up your free electronic picture you took 30 minutes ago.  Grab a souvenier and enjoy the rest of the Seattle Center!"
"Great View of Seattle and fun to visit! The restaurant is a little overrated. I went up to have an appetizer and a glass of wine. $35 minimum. I hit $31 and they would not let me slide- I either had to order more or pay the $18 fee for visiting the Space Needle. This is why I am only giving 3 stars. It was a Wednesday night in January and the restaurant was empty! So to not let me slide for $4 really was disappointing. ,Overall a good place to visit on a clear day as a tourist but not a spot to visit if you don't want to spend a lot of money! As always with anything tourist- everything is overpriced!!"
"The way I see it, the  Space Needle is to Seattle, like Golden Gate Bridge is to San Francisco. ,It is just a landmark that makes you think of Seattle. I didn't go up the elevator because honestly, it looked fine from below. Plus you get to wander around the gift shop and buy stuff that makes it seem like you went up. Not too shabby. Only if you are into souvenirs though. ,My friends and I took some fun pics of this landmark as we made ourselves around the city on various days. It does stand out, even from the view of one of the ferries. Try taking a pic of the space needle coming out of your mouth, that is fun."
Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were nowhere in sight.
"What is there to do in Seattle, I ask....people always respond, well if its your first time the Space Needle is something you should check out at least once!  They were right.  As a first time visitor to the Seattle area, you really should check out the needle ONCE...assuming its not overcast and rainy!  ,The positives: The views are stunning and the needle is close to downtown hotels and other attractions.  ,The negatives:  Why are you charging $19 to wait in line for 25 minutes to go to the top of a tower that is packed with people?  Also, did you really charge $12 for my 5 year old niece that needs to be picked up and carried to see the view?   I've been told that the wait gets longer on the weekends and during the afternoon hours, so I recommend getting their before lunch and maybe on a weekday.  ,Overall great views, but a bit overpriced and crowded."
"It's one of those things you have to do if you're visiting in Seattle.  ,Here's my little tip:  Skip the $19 admission and go have a seat in the restaurant.  Yes, it's pricy.  But it also includes a free trip to the top and a fantastic dining experience.   ,The dining experience is probably worth the price they charge -- I think if the restaurant was anywhere else, you'd probably pay comparable prices.   So, you can either look at it as getting a good meal and a free trip or paying for the trip and getting a heavily discounted meal.  ,Plus you get to skip the line if you've got the forethought to make reservations.  How can you beat that?"
"Love the view, it's breathtaking! The food is alright, not what you'd expect for the price. The best deal if your visiting is to go Monday - Friday during their lunch. You only have to spend $25 a person per meal and you get too relax and enjoy the view. The cost too just go up too the observation deck and walk around is close to $20 a person, so why not have lunch? It's worth it!"
"Ok, the view is amazing and the ride up the elevator and walking the circumference of the needle can be intimidating but breathtaking! ,Be aware that the line was about 30 minutes to get up there (we were trying to see the sunset)"
"I think all in all, it was a good experience for me but it is probably not for everyone. This is just a nice picturesque place to come view some of Seattle. It is by far not the tallest thing even in Seattle nor can you see a whole lot with it although I was fortunate to come on a day where there were no clouds or fog.,The Space Needle shopping center, however, is fantastic :) lots of awesome souvenir gifts and random items for sale including some food items and pasta! I liked it a lot simply because it is a chill thing to do in Seattle and ... whattayaknow, you can get coffee at the top!"
"I've been to Seattle dozens of times, and always enjoy seeing it in the skyline, but haven't been to/near the Space Needle in quite awhile.  I have to say, I really enjoyed seeing it up close again, and especially enjoyed viewing it from the water fountain w/ the musical fountain show.  Might have to bring my kids next time I come, and even travel to the top."
Walk a 360 view of Seattle and also enjoy Seattle Starbucks coffee or tea.  Best view to see with your loved one.  ^_^
"We were there after Labor Day weekend and around 9:00 a.m.  They have a discount if you come early in the morning!  We did the Space Needle and the Chihuly Garden Glass Exhibit.  Both were very cool!  Definitely worth the $$!  Do both, very worth it."
"It's the Space Needle. It's...the mutha...effing...Space Needle. There is no knocking this unique structure that lingers from the World Fair in 1962. Since it's on it's 60th year they've covered the top back to it's original orange, Blech. ,Otherwise, it's no tourist trap. It provides a fantastic view of Seattle from Ballard to Elliot bay almost to the mountains.,Yup, it's expensive but you can take your time lingering around the observation deck. Button up, it's going to be windy and since it's Seattle - it could very well be rainy. To make a night of it, visit the restaurant where your ticket up is included. ,I have also heard the fireworks show is great, but I haven't experienced it yet but plan to!"
"Come early. Leave happy. Otherwise enjoy the line and a busy viewing deck. Consider Kerry Park for a better view, with less people. If money is no object, and you don't mind waking up early then come. Otherwise, opt out.,The cost is considerably high for those going up to the deck, but I suppose the whole thing is part of a tourist, must-try-at-least-once type of experience. While the pictures I took were nice on a clear morning, they weren't as stunning as they were from other parts of Seattle. I can't say I had too much fun bumping into people around the deck. I wouldn't consider coming back here, unless I decided to have a touristy and mainstream experience in Seattle again."
"Yea!  I am officially a tourist!   ,Fortunately we came here on a very clear day. The views are definitely amazing."
"Saw some mixed reviews for this tourist attraction, which is totally fair.  I'm sure its not that cool on a bad day... but we went on the RIGHT day and it was INSANE!  $19 gets you a ticket to the top, and man the views are fabulous.  The big snow capped mountain ranges boardering the city on all sides.  Water, boats, the sound, and telescopes that you can use for free on every side of the observation deck pointing in all directions.  We left a friend at home, and were able to call him and see him waving to us from my cousins apartment.  REALLY cool.  I also like that they don't spend too much time on the historical significance of the space needle.  The story isn't the cooler part... the needle is.  Just go see it... and then go grab lunch or something.  Worth it!"
"It was cool reading the history behind the creation of the needle for the World Fair. I like that at the time they considered it a gamble to erect this structure and had trouble finding financing for the project. Glad they did since this is an awesome spot to look over the entire city. You can even watch planes land miles away at the airport. Also very cool is that they have mounted binoculars for your use and they are free! So much better than the Eiffel Tower! lol. Only downside is that it's like $18 to go up, but still not to be missed as this is a West Coast icon."
"Seriously, i can get this kind of view by just going to a tall rooftop on some random building or just at my job at the Getty Center.,As a first time visitor to Seattle, the Space Needle is usually directed as the ""first"" main attraction. I get there and it's just sitting in the middle of a small park across from Mdconalds, a duck tour, and a small mini shopping center. Uhhh am I at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles?,You have to pay certain amounts to reach to the top depending on what time of day youre going, kind of like the movies. Morning = Early Matineee, Afternoon = Matinee, and Night = TOO MUCH.  You ride to the top which lasts a few seconds and...thats about it. You see the view, the city, the ports, the water, then you realize....... thats about it (again),You can join others at the space needle shop (which i think was my highlight since i love buying little souvenirs) or you can eat at the restaurant at the top ( you need reservations and other tickets for this),But yeah, thats...about.... it."
"One of the best things to do in Seattle!  ,We've come here a bunch of times and found the best tip is eating the restaurant and putting the money toward food instead of admission.  ,The restaurant is less windy. LOL!"
"The expensive elevator ride with a 360 view from the top: every city has one. I went to the Space Needle because I don't live here, and because someone else paid. ,We lined up for about 20 minutes for the elevator. Handy view of the gift shop while in line. Went up to the top, shuffled about with all the other tourists on the narrow observation deck. And I'm sure no one has ever thought this before, but the view, from downtown to the Olympic Mountains, was amazing. ,Once around, pictures taken, I have to go to the bathroom. There are only two bathrooms up there (go figure, with a bar and coffee shop) and someone seemed to be taking a looong time in one of them. One of my cardinal rules is not following those who've taken their sweet time in the John. So that ended that visit. But that was okay, because once around the Needle was enough to re-enact the closing lines of Singles (as the camera zooms out and we hear what all the singles are saying about mating and dating), reminisce about Almost Live, and orient ourselves to lovely Seattle. ,Your expensive elevator ride beats ours, Seattle. The Space Needle is the coolest looking structure that was ever built just for the purpose of  taking tourists' money."
"Yes, I can totally be the quintessential tourist. I so wanted to go here, so the friend I was visiting agreed. We got to the top as the sun was setting, which was such a beautiful time to be there! It would have been even better if my camera wasn't being a jerk.,This is obviously a tourist attraction, so there were lots of people packed into a relatively small space, which isn't my favorite thing in the world. The thing that bothered me the most was a parent allowing their child to stand on the railing (yes, there are additional safety measures, but SERIOUSLY?!?).,The views were absolutely lovely. I love the water, so getting to see so many of the bodies of water that make Seattle the fantastic city it is. The city views were great as well, and I was able to see a little bit of Mt. Rainier. Definitely a great, though touristy, experience!"
Great views when there is no rain or fog. Your pic is taken with the purchase of admission. You can email the pic to yourself and a couple of friends.
"NOT a must do if you are visiting. The building is not terribly tall so although the view from the observation deck is lovely, you can get a good view from any of the neighboring hotels, office buildings. For our family of 4 we spent $86 for a 30 second elevator ride and spent 10 minutes looking around the city. Spend your money elsewhere."
"Space Needle, the famous Landmark of Seattle! If you haven't been up there, please at least do it once! ,The view on the top is amazing! ,The first time I went up there was years ago when I was still in college. I went with friends. However, I didn't remember how much it cost. All I remember was the view from the top. ,The second time I went up there was last February. It was a company party. I paid $50 with 3 drinks and assorted desserts. We partied on the top with 3 different dance floors. The night sight again is AMAZING!,Of course, this is a tourist spot. I really enjoy the shop there even though I don't buy anything. There are a lot of cool stuffs with Space Needles icons and symbols."
Over priced and usually crowded. But a good view from of the city from the top. Worth one visit.
"For a tourist destination, I really like the Space Needle. In my adult life, I first came last September with my mother. On that clear Seattle day, I reveled in the beauty that is Seattle, a place I had visited before but had no recollection of, with the exception of my great-Uncle's gross, cat-filled house he called a home.,I returned to the Needle again a few weeks ago, this time in the evening. It was cold and terribly windy, so we stayed inside. It was quite lovely, though, to be there where there were hardly any visitors so we could enjoy the views from the inside in peace, with a few glasses of wine, while dancing to Christmas music.,What I find about the Seattle Space Needle is that though it is a tourist spot, they don't heavily ""sell"" you on their novelty items. Even the keepsake photo they take of you upon entrance to the elevator can be e-mailed to you for free. I adore the gift shop and though the products are not cheap, they are certainly moderately-priced and would not feel that cheated if I purchased some Seattle goods from there! ,I kind of want to go back, even if I do officially live in Seattle now!"
"If you're visiting Seattle for the first time, it's a must see. I myself went up to the observation desk myself since my husband doesn't do heights and I'm so glad I did. It's a little pricey but what's $19 for a cool vacation experience you may not do again? Went on a Saturday morning and the wait wasn't long at all. Bought the tickets (got the deal ticket for the needle and the Chihuly glass garden next door), walked up to the part where you wait for the elevator, took about 10 minutes before I got into an elevator. So cool to see everything as you ride up to the top and the guide in the elevator gives you cool facts on the way. Spent about 20 minutes walking around the deck taking pictures. Views are amazing! It wasn't windy when I was up there, guess I got lucky. Would have loved to sit in the little café and have a drink while enjoying the view but my old man was waiting downstairs and I didn't want to do it alone.  ,Huge gift shop in the lobby area, also have bathrooms. You could walk around the lobby and the store without buying a ticket to go up if you want. ,Awesome experience, glad I did it. ,I would go in the morning because we walked by again around 3:00 and the lines looked much longer and it was probably more crowded up on the deck. Also if you're staying closer to the Westfield shopping center and don't want to walk the mile to the Seattle Center, take the monorail over for $4.50 round trip. Lets you off right next to the needle. Easy peezy."
"As a tourist in Seattle, I felt the Space Needle was a must do for the city. I've been to two similar places- one in New Zealand, and one in Canada, and this one was definitely my favorite. First, I loved that you can go outside- it was absolutely beautiful and gave you a great view of the city. I love that you aren't so high up so that you can actually find places you have visited. Second, I love the elevator view on the way out- great idea for them to have windows. Third, I love that they take your photo and you can e-mail it to yourself for free without any pressure to buy. It might sound little, but freebies are definitely a rare thing in Chicago, so I was surprised. (Chihuly garden and glass did this too and we got some great shots). I'm sure you don't need to come here over and over, but it was a pleasant tourist experience, and I'm glad I did it!"
"Admission to the top was pricey.  I purchased a Starbucks up there but was not allowed to bring it onto the viewing deck.  The grounds were well kept, the views on the deck were great.,Other travelers in our group went to the Smith Tower and our pictures turned about the same but the Smith admission costed WAY LESS.  ,We felt under-appreciated by the staff and would have saved $48.00 if we went to the Smith Tower Observation deck."
"$19 General Admission,Expensive, expensive... expensive. BUT, worth it for your first time! You *have* to see the Space Needle, it is the iconic landmark of Seattle. During the off season, it's not crowded (when it's winter), but during the summer months, beware for long lines! ,When going up there, I make sure to hit all the telescopes and take pictures over the sound. It is gorgeous. And be sure to go inside of the needle and play with the cool gadgets that they offer. ,Also you get a FREE photo of you and your party before entering the needle and you can view it and email it to yourself at the top, WAY cool!"
"The Space Needle is one of those places you just have to go even if it will lighten your wallet more than it should.  The only complaint I could have is the price.  The price is WAY more than it should be for a 50 year old attraction, but there is a good view.  I've been here twice now.   Once about 10 years ago and again recently aquatinting my four-year-old with the folklore of Seattle.  The experience was about the same both times.  It is worth the visit if you haven't been before, but once you've done it once you're good to go for at least a decade."
"My wife got us the VIP tickets that let us bypass the long lines. I don't know how much extra that cost, but it was worth every penny. We bypassed the long line outside and picked up our VIP passes immediately. Walked in to the VIP elevator and walked on more or less immediately. They first dropped us off at the picture taking place. Again we got to bypass the usual line. Then we went up to the observation deck. I'd say total time from the time we got on site to the time we were on the observation deck oohing and ahhhhing over the views was about 10 minutes.  Very much worth it. ,Of course the views are spectacular. I am sure there are similar observation decks in other parts of the world that are higher. But frankly, the Seattle Space Needle is a good height. You are high enough you see everything around, but you are low enough that you still get to see a lot of details. ,All the staff we encountered was very helpful and friendly. The observation deck sold coffee, drinks, beer, wine, snacks if you wanted them. ,But mostly you are there for the views and they do not force you along a path. You can take as much time up there as you want to."
"Aside from mobility issues, I never understood the appeal of paying money to stand in line for half an hour to go up in a high structure and look at a view for 5 minutes. Every city has plenty of places to clamber up and take in a stunning view for free. They're called parks; Seattle has many including Discovery Park. Alas, I continue to visit these tourist sites (Sears Tower, St. Louis Arch, Coit Tower) because a part of me is curious whether this one will be different. Nope. On the bright side, the Space Needle looks like a spaceship. Every time I saw it around town, the Men In Black theme song played in my head. Also, I was in Seattle for a wedding and the Space Needle was the site of the couple's first date. Cue the awwwws.,Come here if you enjoy paying money to go up in high buildings. If you do visit, make sure it's a clear day when there are good views of Mt. Rainier and Puget Sound. Enjoy."
"It's Seattle. Come on, you have to do the Space Needle at least once. Good thing is that it's conveniently located close to other attractions so it's not like you have to make the visit for just the view. I would skip the meal, just go check out the incredible views of the city, take some photos and be out like flynn. No need to stick around with all the families. Check out the gift shop, get a few goodies.. It's a good one.."
"Tourist trap for a reason... The view is beautiful from up there. The line goes by pretty fast and there are multiple elevators that take you to the top. I recommend going between 6-7pm. We got there just in time to see the sunset and it was gorgeous. $18 for an adult ticket, but ya gotta go at least once in your life!"
"You know what I realized?  The Space Needle is like a big middle finger jutting out of the Seattle skyline.,On my second visit to Seattle, I made two separate attempts to visit the city's most famous monument.  Both times, it was closed for private parties.  How do you close one of your biggest tourist attractions twice in a couple of days?  I want my parking money back.,Three stars because I still like the building.  But shit.  I kind of hate it, too."
"I've been coming here since I was a little girl.  I remember the first time I came, I was completely overwhelmed by the brilliance of the views as I slowly walked around the platform. ,So now I make it a point to take my friends to the Needle whenever they come to town, or a friend who hasn't been.  Because there are no words for the grandeur of the land you're able to see, especially on a clear day.  ,And I have to  say, it sure helped me figure out the different locations (Fremont, Capitol Hill, etc) within the city when I first moved here.  Being able to see from above, as well as being educated via the Magic Boxes (they are free standing computer doohickies located every 10 feet inside the Space Needle) was exceptionally helpful.,It certainly never gets old, and I love going.  I look forward to the next friend who comes to town!"
"If there's one thing you must see when you're in Seattle, it's the Space Needle.  No seriously.  Quite literally, unless you're blind, you can't miss it!  For 50 years, it has towered over the skyline like a swizzle stick over the high octane cocktail that is Seattle.  Perhaps other taller buildings have eclipsed it since it was first built, but no other structure has the unobstructed 360-degree view of the city and beyond that the Space Needle does.  ,Is it a bit too touristy?  Hell, yeah!  But, it is the signature feat of engineering and architectural design of Seattle.  Few other cities have anything as distinctive as the Space Needle.  Is it a bit too pricey to go to the top?  Perhaps, but the view is priceless.  You haven't fully seen Seattle if you haven't seen it from the observation deck of the Space Needle.  Do it once, breathe in the beautiful view, and cross it off your bucket list."
"This was my second time here. The first time was as a young child with my family. I'm sure I did everything I was supposed to do then (look around, take photos, and buy a souvenir). This time around I did the same. ,Great, unparalleled views of Seattle and the surrounding areas. Not surprisingly during my hour at the top it was a mix of cloudy and clear skies. I suppose I should be grateful to have had any clear skies. Something I'll have to learn to adjust to. ,My major complaint is the price. I personally don't mind paying what I need to for life experiences but $19.75 for one adult ticket to go to the top? I understand they need money to operate but that just sounds expensive for an elevator ride. Just thinking a family of four could be close to $70 just to head to the top. (I don't have a family). ,Otherwise great views."
"During a trip to Seattle it is worth taking the time to visit the Space Needle.  It is the city's icon since the 1962 world fair.  Learning that bit and the more of the history of its construction are one of the things to enjoy beyond the view which is spectacular.,PROs:,   1. Excellent view with great photo opportunities.,   2. Free for use viewing devices as well as many controllable cameras.,   3. Fun elevator ride with an open window view.,   4. Free couples pictures on the way in that you can download.,CONs:,   1. Expensive $19/person if you just want to go up for the view.,   2. The elevator is -packed- each trip.  Not for the claustrophobic."
It's historic. It's a definite MUST when in Seattle.
"its cool, one time thing, do it and get it over with , then go see the rest of seattle"
"It costed $19 per person to go on the space needle. No discounts unless you are a senior or military. The line was a little long to buy the tickets and even longer waiting to go up the elevator. They really cramp everyone in the elevator! Also, you can get a digital photo taken for free and sent to your email!,Supposedly, it takes 41 seconds to go up to the top. It was pretty fun. It's pretty cold up there but you get a nice view! Very good picture place! :) Nothing much to do up there besides view the city and take pictures...haha. You can grab a drink while up there to keep yourself warmer too. ,Overall, good experience. When we left around 11am..there was a lonnnnnnnnggger line!! hahas! Rush hour!"
"I visited Seattle for the first time when Microsoft sent me on a trip up there. On the first night staying, I just had to see the Space Needle. I recall paying around $20-ish per person just to ride the elevator up to see the views the Space Needle had to offer. It was past 8pm, and I recall waiting about 7 minutes before we could take the elevator to the top.,They have a small cafe at the top and a restaurant right below it. You can walk outside onto the deck and see a full 360 view of Seattle, which was nice at night. I wanted to eat at the restaurant with my friend, but I did not want to wait 40 min to eat and I did not have a reservation. Looks like I will be saving that part for the next trip.,Upon taking the elevator down, there was a decent-sized gift shop where I ended up getting a cool 3D magnet."
"It is a little pricey, but it is a tourist spot so it should be expected. We did get an excellent value though because we used Seattle CityPass! We visited twice, day and night time. The views are great! The staff in the observation deck were nice. The gift store at the bottom is organized."
"First off...it's a little pricey for an observation deck.  That being said it is quite a spectacular view.  I visited around dusk and got to watch the sunset from atop the outside deck.  There's also an enclosed inner deck with a cafe and seating and interactive displays about the needle and the surrounding areas.   The elevator ride is less than a minute each way.  I enjoy scenic views from high places so it was a treat.  ,Couple of things, best time to go would be around dusk to see the transformation from day to night.  And bundle up cause the outer deck can get quite chilly."
"Visiting Seattle without seeing the Space Needle is almost blasphemy, even for someone who is scared of heights, like me. A friend convinced me to go to the observation deck... Despite my near insistence to pace around the base and shoot exterior photos. ,Im glad I was inspired because the views from the observation level provides amazing views of the area. At the time, it was autumn and the fall colors were fantastic. Perhaps even better were the night views, as I had the combo day/night pass. It was a little chilly up there that time of year, but worth it for the beautiful night lights and scenery. The gift shop was fun too, but expectedly pricey. ,Pros: Seattle landmark--a must see, outstanding views of the Puget Sound/downtown/Lake Union, location in the Seattle Center right by the monorail station,Cons: It's expensive as most observation towers are, the gift shop is perhaps even more pricey"
"I think this iconic tower is a beauty! The views are beautiful and we watched the fog rise when we went up to the top, spectacular experience. ,I would not pay the $20.00 to go up top, but again the City Pass came in handy!,The gift store on the bottom is great and the EMP Museum and Science Center is easy walking distant. Can do all three easily in one day!"
"Cheesy and tremendously expensive for what it is, but iconic and worth seeing once."
"If you visit Seattle, you MUST go to the Space Needle! It's the iconic tourist destination.,I have to admit, it is a little overpriced ($16 / person) for an elevator ride to the observation deck, but definitely worth the amazing view! Great place to hang out, and take pics. I'm giving this 4 stars just b/c the bartender hooked me up with free beers for my Birthday...Gotta love that!!!!,Everyone should visit at least once."
"I'm a sucker for freebies and deals, so when a promo from a contacts solution company was going on last Friday, they had free admission to the top of the needle. As a result, I took advantage of it. Even though I waited for an hour-ish in the sun, it wasn't too bad, and I was looking forward to going up, and seeing the view, because last time I went up there was probably 12 years ago...,Regardless of it being crowded because of the promotion going on, it was a decent, nice view, I have to admit. The telescopes there made the experience sweet, because you didn't have to put coins in it to use the darn thing, and its super magnified---I could see random people sitting at their decks eating, from soooo far away, I felt like I was spy almost. Hehe. ,The thing that surprised me was the walking around the observation deck was QUICK. I guess its smaller than what I thought it would be. The view is wonderful on a clear, sunny day. I'd suppose its worth the $18 bucks, ONLY if you haven't been to the top before, and its on a perfect summer day. Make use of it if you are, meaning, spend as long as you can up there. Other than that, I would say save your $$. There are better views in the city from other places as well."
"i've been to seattle a total of 3 times and every time i visit, i enjoy seeing the needle. the 1st time i went up to the deck {which was several years ago} the view was amazing but for someone deathly afraid of heights...once was enough for me, especially since I could feel the deck slope down the closer you got to the edge. ,parking has gone from free to $8 so expect to search awhile or make a long trek to take a picture in front of the needle."
"Seeing someone else's review reminded me I have also been up there.,I met a client for lunch and he suggested the Needle--of course...me being from California....seemed like the logical place to dine.,It was interesting, the food was okay and I got very nauseous.  I did not realize initially that the dining room was rotating around the center of the needle...very slowly to be sure - but soon I felt WAY queasy....then watching some guy hanging out on some kind of cable set up CHANGING   FREAKIN' LIGHTBULBS was more than my equilibrium could stand.,LOL-quite an experience...don't ask me about the food---it wasn't that important!!"
What else can I say but SPACE NEEDLE! It's one of those must do in Seattle so we hit it up and checked it off our list :)...along with many other tourist attractions. It's windy up there but worth the trip.
"Although it provides great views of the city, it doesn't offer much else. Certain things came to mind; there should be more restaurants and bars at the needle, there should be more doors out to the platform and the wiring obstructed the view and pictures. What we found impressive was the knowledge and timing of the elevator guides and their pitches. I also liked the cameras that could zoom into neighborhoods. What I find interesting is little tidbits of information on neighborhoods/buildings in the direction I am facing, and I didn't see that at the Needle as well. If you're in Seattle, I still think this is a fun experience, but not something that would draw crowds twice."
"Great views of the city from the sky deck. In the peak summer month of September, we waited nearly one hour to board the elevator to the top of the Space Needle. It is a fun experience, however since this was our second visit (prior visit during night hours) it was hard to find the money worth it. The tickets are pricey and the automated ticketing stations didn't have the combo ticket with Chihuly Glass & Garden available as advertised on signs."
Excellent views of the city. Friendly staff. Well organized. Free digital photo. Great experience
"A great attraction if you like the sights.,We came here on the first day of our trip, since the remaining two were forecasted to be cold and rainy.  Admission is kind of pricey, but if you've traveled this far, you might as well experience it.,Fortunately, we went at 730pm, so it wasn't as busy entering, but leaving was an annoyance since the lines were long for the elevators.,Before entering the elevators, they take your picture, which you can later email to yourself for free (thought that was pretty cool).,The views were really nice, seeing the entire city, mountains surrounding it and of course, Mt. Rainier.  Other than that, that's pretty much it for the deck."
Don't come on a prom night.... they get very backed up and your money becomes a total waste!
"Seattle's historic landmark.. built for the 62' World Fair and still remains today as one of the tallest monuments within the United States.. ,and.. yeah, that's pretty much it. ,If your a tourist, it's (kinda) worth checking this out. It's one of those.. ""OKAY! been there done that, and now I can now cross that off my list"" kinda things. ,$18 standard admission per person (-$2 off for military), take a snapshot in front of their green screen for your free ""I WAS AT THE SPACE NEEDLE, BOOYA"" picture, wait in line for the elevator, take a 2 minute 10MPH ride up, take pictures of Seattle on the observation deck, wait for the elevator again to go down, visit the gift shop, and your done. ,All-in-all, I spent $32.76 within 20ish minutes and checked the Space Needle off my list. The observation deck was cool but was fenced up so all your shots will have fencing over them. Also, if you plan on dining at the revolving SkyCity restaurant, it's requires about 24 hour prior for reservations.. (and minimum of $25 per person while dining there). ,PS: the 76 cent expense is from squishing my regular penny for a Space Needle one ["
"I enjoyed going up and watching Seattle from its tallest tower. Having been to Sears and John Hancock in Chicago before, it is similar in opinion but still a nice thing to experience ... ,One of the must-thing-to-do in Seattle ..."
"It's Seattle's architectural claim to fame - a must-do when you are in town, and since both friends that I was with were first-timers, we came here at their request.,And naturally, just like any others, it has everything that a tourist spot would have.  Think having your picture taken in front of a blue screen (and have your image superimposed on the Seattle skyline background - thankfully the digital copy of the pic is free!) and shop selling overpriced made-in-China souvenirs (fridge magnet, useless toys and such).  ,We did get a 360 view of Seattle.  Unfortunately, Seattle without the Space Needle is just like any other ordinary cities by the sea - non-descript sea of buildings after buildings... we could've been in any city for that matter.  Its skyline is not littered with skyscraper so don't expect a view similar to the one from the Empire State Building or the John Hancock.  The Space Needle isn't particularly high either, so it's not like you can see really THAT far into the horizon a la Taipei 101 or Shanghai's Oriental Pearl Tower. ,All in all, though, it really wasn't half bad.  There were tons of places to sit by the window, the 41-second elevator ride was made interesting by an amazing motormouth of a guide who answers questions as random as (1) ""Why is the grass green?"" ""Chlorophyl,"" after only the slightest pause; (2) ""Why is the sky blue?"" ""Refraction of the sun light through the atmosphere""; and (3) ""Why is the ocean blue?"" ""Because the water absorbs the red part of the color spectrum""."
"We were the typical Seattle tourists doing the typical Seattle things ... Space Needle, Pike's Place ... blah blah blah.,We decided to skip the bloated prices of the Sky City restaurant and just pay $18 to go to the top and look around for a bit. I think that $18 is a bit high, considering there isn't much to do but go up there and look, but I understand Seattle has to make their money somehow (I ain't mad atcha!),We went early on a Sunday morning and did not have to wait. We were up there about 40 minutes, enough time for my partner to spend $15 on a hot dog and a drink and to look around and the sites.,I recommend this place if you are touring Seattle ... but I probably will not come here again unless I am bringing an out of towner."
"You totally have to do this if your in Seattle!  You can see everything... super quick ride to the top too.. you can watch as you go up up up!  Try to go on the clearest day you can... which is probably sometime in the summer... when seattle's sky might clear up a little to see the mountains.  ,It's super windy up there so any  hats, etc might fly off! ,There is a cafe up there too and restrooms as well.  My grandma who has a fear of heights went up so you can too!! =)"
"As a local, I'd avoided it.  Tourists.  Everywhere.  But my parents came, and I went.,And it was pretty great.  Touristy?  Yep.  Canned speeches from tour guides?  Yep.  But unparalleled view?  Yep.  No matter how many times I look at this city from somewhere high it still amazes me.  I could walk around that deck for hours and just stare.  Worth the price of admission."
"Yes, I know it's cheaper at the other building down the street, but you have to check out the space needle at least once. It's a quick and smooth elevator ride to the top. It can get crowded up there, but the views are breathtaking. Try it...you'll like it!"
"The last time I visired the Space Needle, it was 1962 & I was 12 yrs old.  So, this was a reunion of sorts for me. ,I've been at other observation towers before & I didn't really expect that much from the observation deck.  The view was obscured by clouds & it was very windy outside.  So, be sure to dress for weather that may be different than 600 ft below. ,I purchased a VIP ticket that allowed me to jump ahead of theclines at the bottom & top of the Needle.  It' was well worth the price to me.  If you buy the VIP pass, they also give you a illustrated map to help you identify the many things that are visible from the Needle, wc was also very useful.,Observationally speaking, you'll grt a better view from the 73rd loor of the Columbia Center downtown (you can take the monorail from the Space Needle to get there) but the Space Needle is unique & everyone back home eill ask if you visited it when you were in Seattle & it'll be lame if you're one of the few who never visited it when they were in town.  ,So, if you've never seen it before, just suck it up and check it out already!"
Over-priced and over-hyped.  The restaurant is very expensive and the view up top is just so-so.  There are so many skyscrapers around Seattle now a days to really be paying attention to this out-of-date building.  It's one of these places that you will go once and never remember much of it.
"Okay, Seattleites I was willing to give your Spave Needle a shot. From the outside, it's an iconic symbol synonymous with Seattle even more so than your coffee. It made for a lot of great photos. ,We walked up to the Space Needle and the line was horrendously long.  We then found the self check out line. We opted for the combo to include a visit to the Gardens. We went for the 9:30pm flight to give us ample time to visit the next door before they closed at 11PM. We lined up at the suggested time, the line was ridiculously long. ,After about an hour of waiting we finally made it up to the top around 10:15. We looked around for 10 minutes and made our way next door (another review for another time). ,We spent more time in line than we did enjoying the view. Being from a city with its own tower, I was underwhelmed by the price and the whole ""flight"" experience. ,I will keep my feet on the ground next time I'm in Seattle and admire from the ground and save myself twenty bucks."
"Whenever you think of Seattle, you think of the fish market and of course the space needle! I really loved visiting the space needle. Again, we used the City Pass and we were able to come once during the day and once at night. The views are beautiful from the outside observation deck but it was so windy the day we went. I imagine it's always windy when you're that high up but this day was extra windy. The space needle is located right next to the Chihuly Garden and Glass (another one of my top favorite places) so you can stop by both if you have the time. ,They have a little cafe inside where you can order food and drinks and enjoy the view. We went home with some nice souvenirs from the shop downstairs. The prices are inflated for obvious reasons but how many times are you really going to visit the space needle?? It was a nice addition to our trip and definitely a must see if you go to Seattle."
"Amazing view on Seattle! The only downside is the line that you have to go through in order to get to the top. We had a reservation at the restaurant, so we had an express, sort of VIP pass to get to the top. You can get some snacks on the top. A store downstairs offers good deals for souvenirs. I am not sure if I will go there again, but definitelly a great experince!"
"I love walking in Seattle. I love coming from Tacoma and spotting the space needle from afar. That being said that's about all I love about the space needle, besides the gift shop. I think it's a little over rated, but what really made me give this two stars is the pricey entrance( $21) and their discount system. The space needle Is not the best view or highest point in Seattle. Is only a historical monument and you go up just to say you went up, but if you're a realist like me you know that is not that good or amazing. To be honest the best picture you can take is from the ground up (of the space needle) from across the street  (front) turn out beautiful like at 1:00pm (because of the sun if you get any). Or in the afternoon (or no sun) from the stairs (in the back). Moving to the discount system. First of all not all Washington Residents receive discount; only king county residents and second of all and most importantly the Kings county resident discount is better than the military discount!!! Really! Like I said before, The view is not all that impressive, being that I have a better view from Mt Rainier in my house ( in the MILITARY base). You can also try the smith tower."
"Before I got to Seattle I was on the fence about going to the space needle. I could take it or leave it. I'm soooo glad that we did it!  What an amazing view!  The plan was to check out Seattle Center but we spent so much time on the observation deck taking pictures that we ran out of time.  The day we went, it was a beautiful, clear day and you could see forever until the storm started rolling in. It only rained for a few minutes but what a great opportunity to get some really awesome pics!!"
"One of the Best places to come in Seattle ! Great view, easy to get to, Lot's of things to do here in this area, You might need at least three hours here !  ( $ 26.00 to see the view at the top ) LOL ."
"Great place, well run. I recommend using the valet. Parking is annoying. The needle is pretty darn cool. Nice city, nice people. It will cost you."
"Tourist trap? Oh well!,So it's $19 to go upstairs and see the space needle so instead, wait until 2-5pm. That is happy hour time and you can go upstairs to the restaurant with a minimum of $25 per person and eat, with a free pass to go upstairs and see the Space Needle. So technically, if you are going to see it anyways, you get $25 worth of food for $6! Definitely worth it. Three of us had some drinks, clams, and other assorted appetizers and then got to see upstairs."
"It seems like an obligatory thing to do here when visiting, and the views are spectacular, but here's my suggestion.  You get $2 off if you buy on-line.  If not, it's $20 / adult and $13 /youth 4-12 for before 10 and after 6 I think.  If you go primetime, it's $26 / adult.  Just eat at the SkyCity restaurant.  It's a minimum of $25pp, and you get a visit to the observation deck included in your meal.  Lunch reservations start at 11 a.m. Just kill two birds with one stone.  I regretted not doing this and paying $96 and change for a ride up at 10:30p.m. for 4 adults and 1 child."
"As iconic as monuments get...,THIS. IS. SEATTLE.,You can't walk around the Town and not recognize this landmark. You gotta go there at least once.,I give this a 5 star review not just for what it is or the service... but what it represents.,This is our city... regardless of how much it rains, that Seattle skyline with the needle as the hero of the story makes any amount of rain bearable. I love this city, a fire burns in my heart that symbolizes my love for this city, and no amount of rain will put that out.,The needle represents all that for me...,PS: this review is for the needle itself... the restaurant at the top is pure rubbish...,5 my-city's-filthy stars out of 5"
Not only one of the biggest attractions in Seattle they have some of the BEST Chefs serving up amazing meals with an outstanding view!  A MUST see when in Seattle!  Thank's Chef Lind!  You always make it special when we come up!
"I'm pretty sure I have skywalk/observation deck/top of a big tower burnout, because there was nothing about the aerial view of Seattle from the top of the Space Needle that looked any different from any other city. Seattle doesn't really have any iconic landmarks BESIDES the Space Needle so if you'd blindfolded me and brought me to the top of the Needle and told me to say what city I was looking at, I honestly wouldn't be able to guess.,That, combined with the jacked-up price, overpriced cafe and pushy tourists, make this a recommended ""pass"" for me. At least at the Stratosphere, there are cool rides."
"When you think of Seattle a few things come to mind as must do's. The space needle is one of them! I got my ticket for the space needle along with my citypass. I was thrilled to get a ticket which allowed us to visit the space needle twice within 24 hours which allowed me to visit once in the day time and once again at night. I you're going to choose one time to go I would opt for the daytime ticket. The night is beautiful, but the day allows an amazing view of the city and makes for much better pictures. The best part is that they allow you to email yourself a FREE professional souvenirs photo! Score!!"
This place is a Seattle landmark. It was in the logo for the show Frasier. It;s in every current illustration of the Seattle skyline. You get a great view of Seattle from the top. I'm not sure it's worth the admission fee though.
"Amazing views.  Thought the experience needed more educational opportunities...the elevator ride up was truly the only time I learned something...and even that was tough to capture the facts as it was fast and hard to follow! For $24, expected more Information!"
"Yes, it was cool to view the entire city and even just to enjoy the outdoor breeze. Not to mention just looking at how all the weight at the top 300' in the air is being carried by a relatively thin set of legs.,But something about the view doesn't scream amazing to me. ,I even got to witness the sun setting behind mountains.,I was quite disappointed since I'm a huge fan of seeing nature seated alongside man made buildings. ,However, at less than $20, it is quite nice to enjoy a marvel for its time.,Btw, I went on a Monday night, and despite missing launch time, I was able to go up and stay up there for as long as I wanted to."
"So worth it!,We went around 10pm and the view was absolutely stunning! They also have a bar so you can grab a drink :) there's a few things to do up there like adding your name and hometown on a giant 3D map and telescopes out on the balcony."
"You have to go here at least once when you come to Seattle. It's a tourist trap, but it's also worth it. Also, go over 6 and you get a discounted rate and a sunset view. It's spectacular."
"Awesome experience, plus we got expedited passes which made us first in line and we didn't have to wait in that long ljne! It was so cool seeing the water & the city with the sunset. Perfect photo spot"
"The view from up the Space Needle is AMAZINGGGG! You get to see Lake Union and Downtown Seattle. I loved it plus we went up during sunset.  Now, before going up they take you a picture and later you can email it to yourself. While going up the elevator a guy tells you about how tall the space needle is and what not and if you have any questions. Up top, they have pictures and facts about the process of building the space needle and how its changed throughout the time, it's pretty interesting. Downstairs they have a gift shop with many cute things and they also have a restaurant up top (i didn't go) but I heard it's quite fancy."
"I know the Space Needle had nothing to do with the great weather but what a treat when it's not overcast or any clouds out.  ,How can you not love this place, $18.00 gets you an all day ticket to hang out and just enjoy the view. I wish it spun so I didn't have to continually move around. ,All in all I had a great time. Not sure if I'll go to the top again right away but if I do I'm going to get the ""City Pass"" and do everything. ,It's a tourist attraction, pay to play. There are plenty of places to park and the area surrounding is just as nice."
"This is an observation deck done right.,Whether you think the views or not are great is up to you, but I thought the view of Seattle was excellent.  You can see all that's happening around the city and the surrounding water.,What really makes this deck different is the staff and what it's like at the top.  Everyone we interacted while waiting in line was happy and exciting.  Usually people running a line are understandably pretty bored, but not here.  It made the ~10 minute wait fly by.  Like most of these attractions, there was the usual green screen photo.  But unlike others, you can send this photo to yourself for free or buy some prints. I'm sure they end up selling a few less prints this way, but I loved being able to have this picture in our e-mail.,Once we got up, the views were great as expected, but there weren't just the great views.  Inside there were plenty of seats and a good selection of food and drink options.  Whenever we go up to one of these observation decks, I always wonder why they don't put a bar up here.  Well I guess someone in Seattle was listening.  There's a bar with a few beers and wines and an excellent bartender.  My girlfriend and I both really enjoyed just being able to enjoy the view and relax.,Would I come here all the time if I lived in/around Seattle? Probably not.  But it's definitely worth a trip to the top if you have some time and want to enjoy great views of the city when you visit."
"Pros:,The place is very well kept.,The gift shop is decently big, with a variety of interesting things in it.,The 360 view that the Space Needle provides is amazing. ,(If you want to get pictures of Seattle, this is one of the best places to take them.),Cons:,The traffic to get there is bad. ,If you have a fear of heights I wouldn't go to the top of the building."
"The Space Needle though cool to go up in, almost feels like a waste of time. And at $20-some bucks a pop, I think the pictures are cooler if you get them outside rather than in. However, it's kind of one of those obligatory things to do."
"Another touristy Seattle draw, but an absolutely worthy one at that. Even when this landmark is past 50 years of age, there's still a timeless quality to the architecture here. And the fact that the Space Needle is located just north of downtown, with nothing immediately nearby to obstruct the view, means that, on a rare clear day, you can grab money shots of the Seattle skyline framed by Mount Rainier glistening in the background, as well as much of Puget Sound and the islands that lie within. Definitely worth the money, especially if you can go during good weather."
"Not much to say about a place like this other than it has an impressive view. The space needle looks orange from afar, but it's actually painted ""galactic gold"". The telescopes up there are pretty powerful! You can actually see people inside hotel rooms. I'll remember to close my curtains next time :-/"
"A very romantic place to go on a date---but make sure you don't go on an overcast day!,You buy tickets inside and wait in the gift shop for them to call your name---valet parking is expensive but if your going to the restaurant too it's cheaper."
"This is a pretty cool attraction if you understand the history. It is not the highest observation tower in the world, but it does offer some pretty incredible views of the city. If you don't want to wait in lines, the VIP pass is a must but it's expensive. Expect to pay $50 to take a skip the line ride up. One thing I really liked was that you can go outside and walk around. I would suggest trying to time your trip up with a sunny day to get the best views."
"I finally made this far up north of my road trip. My buddy and I skated the skatepark by the KeyArena. We headed to the Space Needle after skating. I end up not going up to the observation deck because my friend's an acrophobia.  I don't want to go up there by myself but I will eventually visit Seattle again in the near future. We did lurked inside the souvenir shop.,Is there any cannabis stores near the Space Needle? I want to go up the observation deck while hella stone as a zombie."
"Eh, $19 to stand in line and ride an elevator only to look at fog, i'll pass.  Maybe it's the New Yorker in me, but when I got here and saw the price i was a little surprised and sort of offended.  I'm sure on a nice day it's a lovely view, but this is just not for me.  I'll just stand at the bottom and get my photo for free."
"The worst sightseeing place ever!!!! I have the ticket for 6pm and I got the top at 8pm!!!!! 2hours in the line to go up. And then, it took 1 hour more to go down because only 1 elevator was operating. I WASTED MY PRECIOUS TIME IN SEATTLE!!! 6pm ticket and finish at 9:30pm!!!!"
"We did this with the City Pass, which is the only way I recommend going to the top of the Space Needle. With it, you got to go twice. We only used it once, at night, and it was fun and cool to see the entirety of Seattle at night. I also like that it was a lot less busy at night with a lot shorter waits. We were going to use it a second time during the day, but the line was way too long. This is one of those signature tourist things to do in a city, but it was still enjoyable."
"The view is great. Take your time and check out all the views and interactive information. You can also get a $2 off coupon from a hotel or touristy area.,When you're upstairs you can access the picture that they take of you before you get on the elevator.,A great place to take in the view and relax for a bit."
"If you're visiting Seattle, you MUST check out the Space Needle.  When in Rome, right?,General admission is $19 and the wait is about 45 mins (at least in early November when it's a bit chilly).  If you don't feel like waiting, you can get a VIP ticket for $34 and up you go!  Just fyi, if you're going for the VIP tickets, you can't get it at the self kiosk.  You'll have to go to the ticket booth which tends to have a longer line (mostly old people who doesn't want to deal with the self kiosk).  ,Once you get up there, as you can imagine, the view is PHENOMENAL.  There's a small restaurant and a bar up there so feel free to lounge around at the tables inside while you soak in Seattle."
"The Space Needle can be a quick thing, or you can spend tons of time up there. It's a neat place to view the city. You get a couple of pictures included in your purchase, too! Just make sure you scan your ticket while up in the needle to be sure and email them to yourself."
"Absolutely amazing!,If there is only one thing you could do in Seattle, the Space Needle is it!  We took the monorail out to it from Seattle (which is an easy, enjoyable experience).,Upon arriving, we saw the long lines to get tickets.  Luckily, people standing in line told us the difference between the two lines (ticket window vs kiosk).  If you know how to use a kiosk, use that option.  If you know you're going to visit, I would recommend buying the ticket up front as we had an hour to kill before our ""launch"" time.,Once on the observation deck, it's just amazingly beautiful!  I wish I had words to describe a great an experience this was, but there simply aren't."
"No first visit to Seattle is complete with a jaunt to the Space Needle.  As part of the City Pass that I purchased for my trip, I was entitled to two visits to the Space Needle.  I only made it up the elevator once, and it was at night.,There are some really breath-taking landscapes of Seattle that can be seen from the Space Needle.  The elevator ride is pretty cool but it goes by so quickly you don't really get to enjoy it.  There are a lot of cool techno gadgets you can use that show the history of Seattle and also explain which areas you are gazing upon.  It's certainly a tourist attraction, a one-time must-see that will probably be passed over during the second go-round.,I enjoyed visiting the Needle at night and would have liked to see it during the day since we had such stellar blue skies during our visit.  Alas, maybe another time."
"We stayed less than 2 blocks from the needle and walked over.  The $19 was a bit steep but I wanted to visit an iconic landmark. ,It was pretty clear for an overcast day. The views of downtown and the entire city are simply spectacular. Unfortunately, it is only the restaurant platform that revolves not the observation viewing deck. We walked and stayed for an hour on the platform , relaxing inside cafe to make it worth it. The gift shop at the base of the Needle has lots of offerings."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the Space Needle during my first visit to Seattle. It was a great treat to have while at the time dining and sharing a magical time with my someone special. The service was exquisite, and the views were breathtaking(even at night). I would definitely come here again during another visit to Seattle. The elevator ride to the restaurant was awesome, though I am not so fond if heights. ,A must for anyone new to Seattle!"
"A must go for visitors. Beautiful views of the city, water, and surroundings. Very peaceful and serene to be up there when it is not crowded."
"A must-see in Seattle - 365 degree view of the city! Come a little bit before Sunset and you can watch the city change into a beautiful sea of lights in about 30 minutes! You can also email your picture with a scenery from a day/afternoon/night view of the space needle. ,Tip: Get a $1 off coupon from the guidebook they have in various hotels/visitor centers"
"When some friends visited they wanted to go up to the Space Needle. Living here a year, I've always wanted to but didn't want to spend $19 a person. But, to go with friends, I tried to forget about the ridiculous price and told myself to enjoy it.,After standing in line for 10 minutes the cashier tells us their system isn't accepting credit card payments, and to use the kiosk. A friends had cash and let us borrow, but had they not I would have appreciated someone telling everyone in line this to avoid getting right back into a second line at the kiosk.,Waited again to go up, which I expected. Took a cheesy photo in front of a green scene. Included in your admission cost is a digital copy of this green screen photo, and you even get to pick your fake Seattle background and hold a plastic fish for the picture if you want.,The view is beautiful but holy moly, $19? Take your pictures and you can tell everyone who asks, yes, you've been to the top of the Space Needle.,The bathrooms at the top are limited, so use the ones in the gift shop.,And don't forget to email that fake photo to yourself."
"It's a total tourist trap.. $19 to take an elevator to the top. But.... hey.. you're in Seattle! You have to.  I just didn't want my friends to ask ""did you go to the Space Needle?"" and me to say ""no."" So i paid and went to the top. Yes, the view is beautiful. Is it worth $19? I don't know. ,There's a couple other observation decks in Seattle. The Columbia Tower is one of them. I read that they only charge $5. I didn't go up there, so I can't comment on the view, but I imagine it to be similar. It's actually higher than the Space Needle. So, if money is an issue for your group, consider this option. And if you decide you don't like that view, and you want to go to the Space Needle, you'll only be out $5."
You gotta visit the Space Needle when in Seattle...really for the sake of doing it.  The experience is much like any other high rise attraction:  you really go to the top for the view.  The view of Seattle (on a clear day) is spectacular.
"Being a photographer/tourist, this is the must-go place for me :),I went twice since with the CityPass, after you used the first ticket, you get to go again the next day for free! So the first time we went, we went at night time and it was freezing!!!  but I loved the view and took many many pictures!  The second day, we went during the afternoon and the pictures didn't turn out as great~ so i would recommend everyone to go at night or maybe go to the top around 5pm and watch the sunset!  ,Parking- valet was $15 so we just drove around and parked on 2nd ave for street parking near the Pacific Science Center and walked there :)  we paid around $2-4 for 2 hours!,-Go during night time,-Keep yourself warm,-41 secs elevator ride,-get to take souvenir photos and you can email them to yourself for free!(but they turned out pretty bad for ours - -),-reminded me of Taipei 101 :)"
"Holy crap, are you kidding me? You know, the future just isn't what it use to be, but the future envisioned and embodied by the Space Needle was THE BEST! Ultra modern! Bold! Optimistic! Space age! 1960s. Pow, to the moon and beyond! It's fucking awesome! You get on that elevator with the glass door and zoom! Up you go to have martinis with Frank and Dino and Sammy. Just you and Judy Jetson, ready to experience the ultimate in human self-actualization by pushing buttons and flying jet packs!,I once took some friends visiting from California up the Space Needle on what was obviously prom night for local high schools. Imagine, an ultra-modern, round, spinning space room full of girls in pastel chiffon dresses, corsages and braces, arm-in-arm with pimply faced boys in Penguin suits. Hundreds of them, on a date. It was so twisted I  could barely stand it. David Lynch couldn't have scripted anything more bizarre. It was GREAT! ,...and the food was blah, blah, blah, and the drinks were blah, blah, blah, and the service was blah, blah, blah, the ticket prices were blah, blah, blah. Shut up! It's the goddamn Space Needle for crissake! Go!,If you're in Seattle, go to the Space Needle. Just do it. And don't be a boring suburban schlub about it. Open your imagination. Think about Sputnik, and Apollo 11, and traveling in space. Seriously."
"Tourists delight in this worlds fair creation from the 1962 World's Fair, and even those of us from the Pacific Northwest will pay the aprox. 20$ every 5 years or so for the ride and the view. ,Last time we were there was over Christmas and it started snowing, so romantic! The black cloudy night with the crisp snowflakes! Even the biting wild chill didn't get us down. Don't spend all your money eating there, SO many better place in Seattle. But get a hot chocolate, take advantage pf the photo op, and buy a little souvenir to remember it by. ,It's absolutely a must if you're in the area, gulp down your aversion to tourist traps, this one is a win."
"Of course going to the Space Needle is a must do for all Seattle visitors. Located in the neighborhood of Queen Anne, which is about a mile away from downtown, it is the main attraction of the Seattle Center, which includes the EMP museum, Chihuly  Glass Art Museum and Gardens, as well as the Sculpture Park. To visit the needle, you will have to pay an admission fee and must come at a designated time... I dont remember how much it cost but I did purchase a combo pack which allowed me to visit both the Space Needle and the Chihuly museum for $35, awesome!,At the bottom of the needle is the gift shop, full of Seattle based souvenirs, from shirts, chocolates, artwork, etc. In addition there is an elevator that goes up the the fancy restaurant... don't go there if you are just there for the observation deck! You have to go up a small flight of stairs to a photo op place (to take your souvenir picture behind a green screen), and then go up the main elevator. During the elevator ride (which was less than a minute), a tour guide will give some cool facts about the needle before arriving to the top.,Inside the top, there is a fast food restaurant, and installations around the room with detailed information about the history of the Space Needle. When you finally go outside, you can see a beautiful 360 view of Seattle! You can see downtown, Puget Sound, Capitol Hill... what a beautiful view! It was chilly, windy, and cloudy but still clear to see everything. I heard on super cold days it can get foggy and the view isn't so great. Keep mind of that.. go to the needle and make the most of your view on a clear day!,We probably spent no more than 45 minutes at the needle (at the observation deck, gift shop, and the amount of time waiting). Overall, it was a pleasant time going to this Seattle landmark and seeing the beautiful view of the city from the top of the needle."
"Maybe because I attended a party at the top so I don't feel like I was being ripped off from this place. I'm impressed because they built this for the World's Fair.,Be warned, don't wear short mini skirts at night and try to watch the Seattle night sky from the top. It was freaking cold. So cold in fact that when I went outside I screamed out really loudly, ""HOLY MOTHER *Beep*!!!"". Unfortunately, there were other people outside as well and they looked at me with judgmental eyes."
I recommend  this place if you never  been. The views  are amazing  and also has selfie cameras. I like how the pictures  are free and they will email them.
"Spectacular views and restaurant to boot. Both a good combination for this landmark site in the heart of Seattle. Took an elevator up and saw the amazing views. I recommend coming here on a sunny day such that you can see all of Seattle. It is interesting to note that the Space Needle was designed after Jimmy Hendrix's guitar. ,Also, once you are in the needle, at the top, be sure to sign the electronic guestbook. ,The Good:,Amazing views on top,Clean and very large gift shop at the bottom,Restaurant incorporating into the building, and if you dine there you get free admission to the observation deck,The Bad:,Cost: total for 2 people was well over $40 for admission,Gift shop is over-priced ($50 for a sweat shirt, crazy),Restaurant also charges a lot for its food (you can see the menu online),I would suggest just doing this once and avoid it after. There are tons of tall buildings in Seattle that have amazing views as well for no cost. This is a good tourist spot but nothing else."
"The ticket is too expensive! The view is spectacular for a short tower! Classic tragedy of anti commons. Remove the steel wires and replace it with glass. It is hard to take photos with those wires in the back. Should bring a date to their sky restaurant, the view is just great."
A staple of Seattle tourism. When you buy a ticket you have a 'guide' for all about 1 minute who takes you up to the top and back down to the biggest gift shop I've seen! Not much to do here but visit the top and have a cup of coffee. But the views are really beautiful on a clear day.
"pricey admission but a MUST GO TO tourist attraction. easy drive, paid parking lot. the view at the top is AWESOME(different perspective)!!    alot of people like the view from 'Kerry Park' better(and free) but Space Needle is a landmark and u gotta check it out at least once."
"Having recently visited the Olympic Park in Stratford, my views on the Orbit sculpture weren't changed by seeing the structure in person.,Designed by an artist I usually admire, Anish Kapoor, the formless, assymmetrical Orbit tower is an eyesore which doesn't fit in with the beautiful classical lines of the other stadia in the park. I love roller coasters and even cladding it in the tubular metal form more usually seen on roller coaster tracks couldn't save it in my eyes,That brought to mind the Space Needle in Seattle as a contrast with its sleek lines looking aesthetically beautiful. Celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, the Space Needle was similarly created for a global event, the 1962 World's Fair. It changed the city's skyline forever, its prominent outline seen in the opening credits of shows like Frasier,The Space Needle is located in the Seattle Centre area located north of downtown. Its distance from the other skyscrapers of downtown serve to accentuate its height and perhaps a good way to experience the nostalgia associated with this icon is to ride the Monorail to get to it,I think it has worn its age well and like Concorde, still looks modern despite being old technology. The lifts will whisk you to the observation deck at the top in 41 seconds, fast enough to make your ears pop,The views from the top are well worth it due to Seattle's wonderful location on the shores of Puget Sound surrounded by the the man-made skyline of downtown and the islands as well as the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges as well as Mount Rainier. It's a breathtaking view in every direction and complimentary telescopes enable you to explore the little ferries in the Bay or the figures on the street more closely,There are interactive SkyQ kiosks which allow guests to find out more about the sights of Seattle that they're observing,If your wallet can stand it, SkyCity restaurant will offer a meal with an unparalleled view,I didn't find any evidence that this was a secret alien flying saucer as shown in one of the Men in Black movies!,Seattle, be grateful you have the Space Needle. I, on the other hand, can't wait til they demolish the Orbit"
"Although the view was pretty amazing, I found the overall experience to be a bit of a rip off. I mean it's essentially one of those things where you shell out big bucks ($20 a person) to go up and snap a photo to say that you've done it and never return lol. I guess if you're in town and have never done it, might as well try it at least once for the view if for nothing else"
"You do this once, unless you like wasting money.  I think it's a total rip off price wise and the launch times idea seems just stupid.  But once you're up there it is a great view.  You wander around for 20-30 minutes and take the obligatory tourist snap and then you leave.  DO NOT go to the gift shop unless you'd like to be relieved of more money for an overpriced Space Needle lanyard."
"We came here on our first trip to Seattle!  The views are great on a sunny day, the elevator is really cool (it looks out on Pudget Sound as you go up), but the waiting line and the price are ridiculous.  You just go up, take a peek, and come back down after waiting in a line for an hour and paying $30 each.  But it is something you should do once.  And then never pay for it again lol."
"Are you afraid of heights? Good, this should be exciting for you, especially when you step out on the observation deck and see the Giant spider cleverly painted onto the roof of a building to look as though it's coming your way to climb up and greet you! The food is a tad expensive but more then worth it for the fantastic view especially at night. You can have you a picture taken and printed as a souvenir. and there's not much walking involved, about five minutes. The rest of the work is done on the elevator, also quite exhilarating considering the fact that you can see out onto the city below quite well. Little know fact: employees are told not to say (even for fun) that there's an astronaut buried under the space needle. Why? I don't know. Frankly in my few visits here, I never heard anyone ask! FISHY!!! lol... please enjoy your trip, and remember that there's lots to do in this area. It's well worth the visit! Enjoy yelpers :)"
"A typical tourist venture, the Space Needle did have the added advantage of a meal if you are so inclined. The service was excellent but the food didn't match the service nor the price. It would be extremely difficult to beat the views though. I recommend coming here with the knowledge it will be expensive."
"A must do in Seattle, especially if you get a clear day!,$18 to the top to spend as much time as you like. Coffee and food sold up there. At the top, part is inside and part is outside and it was bigger than I thought - not super crowded that you can't move around.,Get there early or expect to stand in line for a long time. They are open until midnight so make sure to go at night as well!"
"I am a sucker for all things touristy. This works well when I travel for work and when I travel for work and have down time or get stuck in Seattle for an extra night which is what happened this time. This trip I wanted to see the Space Needle but didn't have time because I was leaving right after my work event. Well the universe had other plans for me and cancelled my flight so I was rebooked for one the next morning. Thanks good karma! Well when in Seattle do like the Seattlians do. ,I loved the Space Needle but once again I am a sucker for touristy things. The views were amazing and it really offers a good time to reflect. The weather wasn't that bad and it was not crowded (I went in early March on a Wednesday). For me it is always great to visit such a great well known landmark. Crossed off the list! On to the next item."
"Disclaimer: I only made it here because my employer gave me a pre-paid ticket. Otherwise, I think $30 is a bit steep for the experience of scaling a tower, especially since I work in a skyscraper already. However, tourists flock here in droves, and locals receive flak if they've never made the trek downtown to say they've been here. In short, you're probably going to end up here if you're in Seattle. Seize the 360º viewing deck to your advantage, and go shutter-happy; you want to milk your money for what it's worth while checking it off your city bucket list."
The lines are terribly disorganized. Seriously spent over 3 hours just waiting. Not worth it.
"Surly staff, broken elevators, and 2+ hours standing in line (with a confirmed reservation no less). They obviously overbook and have no contingency to deal with mechanical issues should they arise. Despite the delays being over two hours,  guests waiting in line were told the delay was 30-45 minutes.  One can assume this is to keep down the number of those who would otherwise demand refunds.  ,  Unless you have nothing else on your itinerary be sure to inquire as to their operational status before getting sucked into line.,  On the positive side the view is spectacular, just not worth the hassle in my experience."
"A lot of times when you go to a restaurant whose primary claim to fame is their location or their view, you expect to be disappointed in food quality or service.  This was definitely not the case at the restaurant in the Space Needle.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation but they very efficiently put us in the elevator, took us to the top and got us seated with minimal delay.  They also gave us great seats in one of the very few booths that put us side by side so that we had a continuous view of the rotating landscape.  From there our very capable and knowledgeable waiter came by and we were treated to a series of dishes that were outstanding.,We had the charcuterie plate which included Beecher's cheese baked into the meat in a very unique manner and then her majesty had the tenderloin while I had short ribs.  All of this was excellent and well complimented by a very good martini for her and an outstanding glass of malbec for me.,The only very minor negative was that, after that outstanding meal, we were disappointed by the chocolate and caramel tort we ordered for dessert which tasted like plastic.,Other than that, the meal was excellent and, while pricey, this place is highly recommended."
Went on a beautiful sunny day and thought it was great. Worth it for the money. I like that there is a camera installed where you can scan your ticket and it takes a picture of you. Then you use one of the machines inside to see it and email it to yourself and others. It takes away that feeling of needing to get the perfect picture or selfie since it takes it from a good angle. I would do it again if I was in Seattle with someone who had never been there before.
The lines are really slow! I have seen people do their taxes faster than the staff at the Space needle process and print tickets! If the government can make something as paying taxes difficult and yet the staff at the Space Needle make getting a ticket to ride an elevator even more difficult. This is ridiculous!
"Paid $19 to go up the elevator that takes about 41 seconds to get to the top and see the view of Seattle. I wasn't expecting much, but ended up enjoying the visit more than I thought! They have an app for the Space Needle and when you use the app 's camera over the circles on the floor at the top, a graphic pops out for you to take a picture with! It's all around the top for many photo ops! There's a lot of historical facts and they even give you free professional photos for you to email yourself at the top and bottom of the trip. It's super windy up there during my visit which was really hard to take my photos without getting my hair all up in my face, but it was very enjoyable. There's a restaurant called SkyCity at the top as well, but I didn't get the chance to eat there. At the bottom is a gift shop as well. I love how energetic the workers are as well :) definitely a place worth visiting when you come to Seattle!"
"Great view, good for sharing with your tourist relatives or even just to get a different view of the city. Ticket price isn't super cheap, but you can hang out up there for as long as you feel like it. On nice-weather days it can get really crowded!,But I do enjoy the little speech that the elevator operators give on the way up - it's educational and fun!"
"Tourist trap! But I went here anyways :P,I saw the night view which was pretty cool.,Overall, not worth the 18 bucks."
"I went on a clear day, and wow the view was amazing from the top. Quite expensive to get up there, but the 360 view was very worthwhile... just make sure to take pictures! There are binoculars up top, so you can stalk people? There are also kiosk machines in the café that tells you interesting information in certain areas of seattle. Overall pretty interesting experience. Would be a five star if not the ridiculous price of the ticket ($20) at the time. Definitely a to-do thing if you're visiting seattle."
"Yes, do it. Take photos. Ride the elevator up to the viewing deck. Walk around the perimeter. Feel woozy from the sway of the wind. Take more photos. Next time a guest visits after you move here for work, repeat from the top."
"30 dollars is pretty steep, but that's the price you pay to go up into THE World Famous Space Needle. Because of this, we frequently eat at Sky City Restaurant which has pretty decent (while appropriately priced for tourists) food and also rotates, and then visit the top viewing deck for ""free."" ,Once on the deck (or in the restaurant), the views of Seattle are great (high up, but without completely losing a sense of scale like you might in, say, the Columbia Tower) and there's a lot for you to peep geographically (including tourists themselves with Go Pros on a stick). There's a viewing deck indoors at the top as well with some little cafes... if going outside seems scary or if it's raining like the dickens. Sadly, the outdoor area is covered by a giant cage, so enjoy seeing that in the background of all your selfies. On the upside, however, the Needle is very accessible via Monorail (which leaves frequently from Westlake) and there's a lot to do around Seattle Center once you spend the 40 minutes it takes to see everything there is to see from the viewing deck (15 minutes of which you will spend waiting in line to ride up in the only elevator). Activities in the surrounding area include: visiting the Pacific Science Center (costs money), Sculpture Park (free), or Chihuly Gardens and Glass (costs money). All in all, worth it to go to whether you're a tourist or posing as a tourist... you know, just to say you've done it."
"Awesome view! Recommended for anyone visiting Seattle. Although, it's too bad they don't have stairs to the top. I would of walked up a million stairs to avoid that elevator. The elevator goes 10 mph, and if you're not a fan of elevators like me, you will not enjoy it."
Loved it ! We ate at the revolving restraint. Kids left little notes on the non revolving window sills (only the floor revolves) and whenever you saw one you could respond ;) very cute unfortunately none of the clothes in the gift shop didn't fit :(
"Went here with my Wife, Mother and little brother.  We all had a great time, and got some great views of the city.  ,""$20+ dollars to see the views of Seattle-I'll pass. My friend actually took me to a place in Seattle where the view was better but I will  need to ask her the name of the place. I think this place is a tourist trap. If you really want a picture, just stand next to it and pretend you were there.""  By Nancy Y., reviewed on 11/30/12,Really Nancy?  Your friend took you to somewhere with a better view?  Did they fly you up to a spot in the sky in their private helicopter?  Come on...its $20, you pay it or you don't.  Don't give it a negative review because you didn't even go up it.  If you have a local to show you around, cool, but its completely useless to complain about the space needle, then say you have a better spot, and not even remember where it was.  Must've been good spot.,However, a good spot for views of the city is here:,400 Broad St,Seattle, WA 98109"
"Great for an experience for those who haven't been on anything high before. Pricey and crowded (recomend getting the Seattle City Pass if you do). The view of seattle is OK. Not worth the price. The only nice thing about it is ""it"" and you can get a ""free"" and spectacular view of it with the city from Kearry Park (Queen Anne & Highland). Of for about $5, you can go to the Columbia Center Sky View Observatory and get a great view looking down on Space Needle. But if you want a 360 degree view, go to Columbia Center Sky View Observatory for about $7, almost no line and a unique experience on a glass elevator."
"Gorgeous views!! Definitely a ""Must-See"" if your passing through Seattle. They offer an observation deck where you can go out and take better pictures from the top levels! I went to the Willis Tower observation deck (in Chicago, IL) which was amazing but Seattles Space Needle is outside and allows you to capture the beauty beyond the glass window! ,Prices are reasonable. Approx $20 for adults, and $12 for kids. ,They offer food and PLENTY of souvenirs. The gift shop is huge, I got lost in it for hours =)"
"The Space Needle is awesome! I've traveled a bit, so I've been to similar observation decks--Reunion Tower(of course!!), the Tower of the Americas, the Stratosphere, the Eiffel Tower--so this wasn't a new concept to me, but it was still fun.  We didn't eat at the restaurant at the top because we heard it was pricey.  Gosh it is a beautiful monument, though.  Even from the ground it's structurally striking.  Also, it's in SUCH a cool area!  The EMP building and all the  modern and pop art scattered around the area makes it so aesthetically pleasing--I could spend all day there!"
"It's the Space Needle.  It's a tourist trap, but a cool one.  Prices are high for what it is.  I paid less for the Hemisfair in San Antonio as well as the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.  We have a large family of 2 adults and 4 kids.  It seems they punish you for having kids by keeping their prices high as well.  Needless to say, although it was cool 520' up and $80 later, this is our only trip to Seattle and we will not ever be back."
Had to check out the iconic space needle while visiting since it's a must see. Went up during the night and the view was decent but wasn't worth the price of admission or wait to see.  If you are in the area and purchased the city pass or want to say you've been there go ahead otherwise ehh.  The staff inside the elevators were very friendly.
"The Space Needle is a must see experience. Although the hefty price kinda makes you feel differently. I had read other reviews that the admission price can vary. My wife and I paid $26.00  each and it was a overcast and turned into rain when we were at the top. I like the 360 degree views and the feeling being up that high. Great  for pictures on a clear day. The gift shop is as big as the observation deck. It would be nice if they had some kind of movie footage on the construction and history you can watch instead of hanging out around the gift shop. When we went it was very crowded and people all around you with not much moveable space. I did not like when they pack the elevators so tightly with people. I could not observed the views enough going up. Paying the high price should have allowed more than  that,  feeing like cattle in a pen. recommend getting there early without the crowds."
"The space needle is so iconic Seattle that I thought it was one of those things I haaaaad to see, no matter how cliche and touristy it may be. With full intent of embarking on the glorified elevator, my traveling party and I were met with a long and winding line that seemed almost endless. Not all that invested in the first place, we gave up on the space needle as the experience seemed to be brief and didn't amount to the overpriced value of a ticket where you'd spend more time in line than taking in the Seattle view. ,The space needle is beautiful from the outside (but much smaller than you'd probably envision). My vote is to take advantage of other ways to reach new heights to experience a breathtaking view as there are many in Seattle with all its skyscraping buildings."
"You can't go to Seattle without checking out one of their major tourist attractions. General admission is around $20 which I personally think is too expensive but the bf and I happened to purchase a Seattle CityPASS for $64. It's basically a booklet of tickets to many popular attractions around the city. Since many of the general admission fees range from $10-$20, it's a perfect option to see as much of Seattle as you can at such an affordable rate. Not only is the Space Needle included in the CityPASS but it offers 2 visits to the top within 24 hours. That means you can see the beautiful Seattle skyline during the day AND the evening!,The first time the bf and I went was right after we had dinner at The Pink Door to celebrate my birthday. It was around 10pm on a cool late August evening. As soon as we arrived at the Space Center I had my booklets ready to go but the bf said we should walk around a bit and check out the areas surrounding the site. I didn't see why we should since everything else in the Space Center was closed, dimly lit and empty--but next thing I know we're holding hands, facing each other at the bottom of the Space Needle and he gets down on one knee and asks me the most important question that I'll never forget =),So as you can probably guess by now, the Space Needle holds a VERY special place in my heart.,The entrance to the elevators is located at the side of the building. A bag check is required and then an obligatory photo of you standing in front of a green screen is taken. Soon after you're escorted to the elevators which takes you all the way to the top. The view really is amazing. You can see the entire city lit up. We went around 10pm and there were still plenty of people on the deck. Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared for the cold weather. It was August but you should definitely bring a light sweater just in case you go up there at night. As for the view during the day, we were able to return the next morning to get one last glimpse of the city. The weather was a bit cloudy and cold but the view was still breathtaking.,Not only can I check off the Space Needle from my bucket list but I can also check off getting engaged to my best friend on my birthday--THE best 2-for-1 deal ever! =)"
"Yes, this is a very touristy thing to do but you need to do it at least once in your life. There's no need to wait in the long ticket line as there are self service ticket kiosks that you can use.  It ain't cheap!  $18.00 for an adult ticket.  They give you a ride up time & you're good to go.  On the elevator run up, the elevator operator gives you the history & low down.  Once you're up, you can make your rounds around the top.  It's a little nerve racking because I'm afraid of heights.  Outside it feels a little odd due to the slant of the walkway.  It's crowded with everyone & their mother trying to take their pictures.  O.K., this is checked off our list."
"Must see if your in Seattle. I went at night and the view was spectacular. There are interactive features on the observation deck. Also a coffee bar with snacks makes spending a few hours here ok, which you will want to do once your up there."
"Amazing views!  Seattle icon.  Go early to buy your tickets though, otherwise you will wait for ever!"
"Was a silly tourist thing to do. Plus, it was cheaper to do a bundle ticket to chihuly and space needle. Was neat to see the city from above. Went on a great day. No crowds,  lines or problems. Weather was perfect."
"It's something to see if you are visiting Seattle. I was visiting last week and bought the tickets for the needle and the glass museum next door. The needle was not that Impressive, the view was alright but there aren't much to see after you walk around the needle which took about 1 minute. I went at night. The gift shop was cool though. The needle just wasn't worth the $19. Because later on my friend took me to some hill close by and the view was better there for free. ,But the needle is pretty to look at but not in it."
"Great views of Seattle and beyond here and if you buy your tickets online, you save a good amount of money. We were lucky not to have to deal with any lines and it is definitely worth a visit for a tourist like myself. Elevator ride was pretty cool since you get to enjoy the views there as well. Their photo website however is not very user friendly and we were not able to see the free picture that was offered with our ticket."
"I have no idea why this thing was built or what purpose it actually serves but - it's really cool!  It looks like a spaceship and it's a great landmark in a city full of (not as) tall buildings to find my way back to my hotel.,After dinner, a group of coworkers all headed down to the Space Needle - we went up, we got yelled at by security for trying to bring miniscule cups of wine out to the outdoor observation deck, we enjoyed the view, noted the sunset was still visible in the West at like 11-freaking-pm at night, we played with the interactive exhibits, took pictures and left... all in all, very fun and worth the price of admission for a late night group activity.  ,The view is amazeballs - especially fun watching the sun finally go away and the moon rise."
"The Space Needle is pretty cool, the wait is a bit obnoxious though. I think only 2 elevators were being run when we were in line so things were going very slowly.,I feel like stopping by is one of those things every tourist needs to do lest they be judged by other people when they return and are asked ""did you go to the Space Needle!?"",It can also get pretty windy up there so be prepared for that.,I'd say the Chihuly Glass and Garden exhibit right next to the Space Needle is the real star of the block though. The art there is magnificent and if you bring a digital camera or instagram filter, you are going to wow your friends with the pictures you can take!"
"You have to do this at least once even though they charge a King's ransom for the ride up. The best view is outside so bundle up this isn't Southern California. There is a restaraunt at the top, haven't eaten there but I am pretty sure it is priced for the view."
"One of Seattle's landmarks. Definitely a tourist destination...that's why I came. Besides the awesome view from the spinning deck, nothing really special. Take a couple of good pictures and that's it. Also, you can buy overpriced souvenirs at the store in the first floor."
"Look, its the Seattle Space Needle. You're gonna go, and its going to be awesome! The views up there are breathtaking. We went on a clear day and got free admission to the observation deck with our Sky City Brunch (the restaurant at the top of the space needle). I have a feeling that it would have been a totally different experience on a cold, windy, or cloudy day, but on a warn and clear June morning, it was fantastic.,Keep in mind, the price of admission is $18. For $45 a person, you can get brunch on the weekends in SkyCity and get free admission, which makes the price of a really good brunch seemingly more affordable. Especially since you don't have to share your view with dozens of other tourists"
"It's just something you have to do at least once. General admission is $19. You can stay up there as long as you want to. Beautiful views (if it's not foggy, of course)"
"Average tourist trap.. pricey, but views that were worth it. I do not understand why they only had one window open to serve a big crowd.. that was painful. Poor guy was kind of nervous.. that isn't fair. Great gift shop and plenty to choose from. We did not visit the bar/grill, but we passed it a few times going up and down and it smelled great. We stayed mostly on the outside since it had the best views. It is small and time goes quick, but it kind of is a must stop."
"Went here for ""date night"" makes it much more affordable. Great food, wait staff wonderful just wish it was more affordable all the time ."
"I love the view from there. A very good overview of Seattle and I kind of enjoyed being in that so famous sight.,I have to say that we took the city pass which gave us 2 accesses, one by day, one by night. Those are two very different experiences that deserves the move, I just can't say if it deserves its price since I don't know how much it regularly costs."
"We had a clear day and got to see Mt. Rainier.  Amazing views.  ,*****Look for a Pepsi can with the $5 anniversary coupon and enjoy a cool, refreshing drink while you wait on line.  The ticket gal asks you to recycle the can in a Pepsi bin and you save 5 bucks on admission."
"very pretty view of Seattle,come early in the morning when it's not crowded at all. you will have a great experience the earlier you come. there's outlets upstairs to charge your phones. i spent a good hour up on the space needle eating breakfast and planning the rest of my adventure in seattle for the day."
"Finally! I finally got inside the Space Needle! And it was no less spectacular, and frightening than I expected!,I have a seriously crazy fear of bridges and high structures. I guess my fear is of falling...which I had tons of nightmares about as a kid. But I really wanted to overcome that in order to travel to the top of this 1962 World's Fair relic. My love of history, I guess, outweighs my fear of heights.,First of all, I highly, highly recommend you get your butt out of bed early and take advantage of the ""Early Bird"" deal the Needle offers. Discounted tickets, no line at all!!(during our visit), a private elevator (because there was no line). We felt like VIP's! When we got to the top, there were only a couple other people there! It was completely tranquil! About 20 minutes later, more and more people started to show up and I became very thankful we got their early to enjoy the views without the crowds. I forgot to mention, before you even go up the elevator, you get your photo taken for souvenir photos afterward, and it came out fairly decent.,I was in fear of the needle swaying...at first, when I stepped out of the elevator, I thought for sure it was. It felt like I stepped onto the deck of a boat. But that may have just been my wobbly legs shaking with fear! I never got the impression the needle was moving again after that. It felt sturdy...but it was a calm, sunny day with little to no wind too. ,The view from up there is, as might be expected, amazing! the deck is open to the elements, (wind, sun and rain) but there is a roof over the deck if I remember correctly. There are beams in place to prevent anyone from jumping off. Thank the Lord God for that! There are telescopes on the deck that are free to use (thank you!!). Inside there is a coffee shop, tables and chairs to sit an relax. Just one floor down is a restaurant. I think I would be too scared to death to eat there! I was secretly dying to get down the elevator as soon as possible. I was petrified the thing was going to fall the whole time I was up there. I can't see enjoying a meal under those circumstances.  ,This is a tourist spot that is worth the money to visit. I can say now I did it, and that is good enough for me. I am not sure I would do it again...because I am a scaredy cat when it comes to heights....but don't let my necrotic tendencies spoil your good time! Do it!! Oh, and the gift shop was pretty cool too!"
"Yes, it's touristy, but it's still cool to see an entire city from the top.  The lines moved quickly.  We had some wine (quite good wine, I was surprised) and enjoyed the view.  There is also a large gift shop (of course) that we meandered through.  Overall, it's a fun experience."
"Yes, this is a place to take your out of town guest, or finally go after living in your city for a while, like me! The views on a nice, clear sunny day are awesome, and I am sure the same can be said on a clear night as well! ,Bring your camera, bring a sweater or light jacket! ,Great for proposals! But then again I am sure a lot of people do that too! ,May be one expensive elevator ride, but it's something you got to do at least once in your lifetime in Seattle!"
"I was actually surprised that it wasn't as tall and imposing as they make it out to be. We almost missed it when we were driving towards the Seattle skyline. It was a bit cloudy when we were up there, but it still gave us a beautiful view of the city. Wasn't anything super exciting, but it's definitely something to do if it's your first time in Seattle."
"Great 360 view and history about this tower is interesting too. Friendly staff and very informative. There is a tourist trap in the gift shop as usual...there is a science center, park and restaurants near the tower..easily to spend a day around."
"I haven't been to the top of the Space Needle sense I was here at the World's Fair in the early 60s. It was a thrill then, and it still is!,Nothing can beat the 360° view of Seattle and its surroundings. Fantastic! The observation deck lets you stroll along and stop to stare down in any direction you want to. Inside the observation level is a small cafe/bar where you can get a cup to toast the view and the city.,Expensive, but very enjoyable."
It's good as a once activity. The views are nice but so are the views from out on the water of the bay. I thought it was over priced for what it is but if your a first time tourist you should go. This is one of the Seattle land marks. Be sure to look for the roof top with the spiders on it.
The space needle was one of our last stops in Seattle. I don't think we would have missed out on too much had we not seen it. It is still a unique piece of architecture. It's definitely not worth paying to ride the elevator to the top of the space needle. I would suggest viewing the space needle and city skyline from a park across from the city like gasworks
"If visiting from out of town I would likely recommend other places to visit first (the water front, pioneer square, Pike Place) but if there's time and interest the Space Needle observation deck is a great option!,I hadn't been up top in a number of years and was impressed with the updates they had made. There are cameras pointing out that you can manipulate and see different views! There are is also a cafe for snacks, coffee and wine.,We ate at the restaurant (Sky City) and I was sooo disappointed so would highly recommend dining elsewhere!"
"Afraid of heights are you? I is. This place is choice for a quick view of the Seattle skyline. Great for family and tourist (a must stop for tourist). if you are lucky enough for reservations at the restaurant I highly booking in advance. this price is a little steep for just the space needle, i recommend the city pass well worth it.,great place for a romantic date."
check out the screens with interactive time lapses of the skyline. its 360 degrees of dated timelapses.
"Awesome view, took family here and had a lot of fun. Food and drinks are a little pricey so tip would be to bring you own drinks and food."
"The iconic Space Needle was our last stop on our Citypass tourist assault of Seattle. ,It is a very cool and retro landmark that will always remind me of the Sonics. Since we were in this area often for other attractions, we just waited until there wasn't much of a line and hit it. The Citypass allowed us to forgo the ticket booths and go straight in line for the elevator. We could also visit twice in the next 24 hours (it is open until midnight). If you go when they open, you'll pretty much be the first people in line. ,A short wait in the line and we were riding to the top in one of their three elevators. Once up top, we grabbed a brew and water to cool off. You can't take those outside, so we just walked around inside looking around. It was another gorgeous day in Seattle (we lucked out with great weather for most of the trip) and we could see plenty in all directions. We saw the stadiums and downtown, Mount Baker, Rainier and the Cascade range and the waterfront all around. There is a lot of room up top and on the observation deck. ,I really enjoyed our stop at the Space Needle and it gave us great views of the city. Pass on the Monorail and just walk to the area."
"Get the City pass it's the best deal. The needle was a good place to go. They have the outside observatory deck and they also have a lobby area inside, where you can sit down enjoy the view, read a book, grab coffee or have an adult beverage they also have choices for kids & interactive area. While you're there sign into their guest book!"
"The space needle is something you have to check out if it's your first time in Seattle just because it 's a known landmark. It's on postcards and pretty much if you see it- you know it's Seattle. It's pretty cool because they have museums in the surrounding area. Only thing that bugs me is that its pretty damn expensive. 20 bucks for admission and you can only be up there for so long ya know? Although admissions is expensive- I do appreciate that you get a a silly photo of yourself for free.. unlike top of the rock in New York.,Giving this 4 stars because it gives you a 360 view of beautiful Seattle."
"Beautiful views of the city, has a coffee and snack shop up there to grab something if you want. $22 per adult. You can stay up there as long as you want (until close) - pretty cool! There's a touch wall where you can sign the guest book and see all kinds of pictures people have taken up there."
"It's THE icon of Seattle, so how can I give it less than 5 stars?,Sure, some may argue that it's hokey and outdated.  Others quite justifiably feel that it is too crowded, too expensive, and too touristy.  You can't see this icon of the skyline when you are standing on it (the Eiffel Tower in Paris has the same problem).  There was controversy when you refused to fly the Pride flag for the second time, despite being willing to fly the 12 Man flag year in and year out.  And you broke my heart when you stopped doing the 4th of July fireworks the very year I moved to the city.,But you do New Year's fireworks with flair, your Christmas tree makes me smile, and while I didn't particularly care for your orange coat, I like the idea behind it and the new green and white trees design is much more visually pleasant.  You are the eminent Seattle attraction and a key reason to visit the Seattle Center for out of towners.  I've been up twice (using the City Pass) and that's definitely plenty for this local, because it is expensive.  But seeing it as I walk or ride to work is 100% free and it always brings a smile to my face."
"An incredible experience! Can't leave Seattle with at least taking a ride up to the observation deck. I highly recommend dining at the Skycity Restaurant and try the American Kobe New York Strip, which is the best steak you could have in Washington."
"A must-see when visiting the Seattle area! An Emerald City Gem!,We purchased our tickets for the observation deck through ,Ask how you can get a free visit to the observation deck with your dining experience. This offer may no longer exist or may have certain restrictions. Please ask the appropriate representative for more details."
Unfortunately all my pictures from my visit here were deleted when I switched iPhones so much for me using the iCloud. We are at the restaurant and it was decent but the prices reflect the view not so much the taste. I ordered the fish and chips (cod) I wasn't impressed. Can't remember what we ordered but I do remember he liked his entree more than I did. We bought the tickets online and parking is free when you eat in the restaurant. It was a great day in Washington minute the rain. One of the best weekends all around because we saw Lion King on Broadway.... Spectacular treat for me that weekend and a massage. Great times!
Awesome place to visit! A bit pricey but it's definitely worth it. The views are unbeatable! And it's a real piece of Seattle history!
Good place to see Seattle in an aerial view. I think the $19 fee is a bit high because most people don't spend too much time up there.
"Appreciate the beauty of the Space needle from below and from afar because it's not worth paying $18 to go up the elevator just to see the view of the city. ,However, if you are going to dine at their restaurant, the elevator ride and the admission to the observation deck is free. ,Tip: If the lavatories on the  observation deck are busy, go down the stairs next to the yellow elevators and turn left, where you'll find more facilities."
"I have never been to Seattle. I bought the Seattle pass and I got to see the Space Needle during the day and night. It's so worth it. I'm not sure I would go back anytime soon but it's worth to see once during the day and once at night. The great thing is that they take a picture of you before you go up, so you can send an e-picture of yourself thru email. The store downstairs is pretty fun to look thru. I was told that they change jewelry artist pieces that they carry change every week. ,Only thing is that if you go on Friday or Saturday night, taxis are tight and hard to come by. I  when on Saturday night by myself. I used my Lift app and I kept on hitting it like a mad woman till I finally got a car avb cause there were no taxis or ubers beside some shady looking guys who were hustling passages. Also bring your backup battery for your phone."
"This attraction has become the icon of Seattle.  Its not the tallest structure in the city but many people will come here to ride the elevator to see the city view.,I didn't pay or go up (as I have been up the tower in Berlin) but the gift shop below was entertaining, and had plenty of things to see.  The restrooms were also very clean and greatly appreciated.,The fudge stand had excellent fudge, and they'll give you a reasonable sample if you ask.,Overall, a great stop at this tourist attraction."
"Although this place is a huge tourist attraction, I think it's very overpriced. Your basically paying $20 to go up an elevator so you can take pictures of the entire city. It is a historical monument though and I do think everyone should go to it at least once."
"Since I got the CityPass, this was one of the admission tickets offered in the booklet. It's a great viewpoint, and with your ticket, you are allowed two admissions in 24 hours. At most, you'll spend 30 minutes up there, cause there isn't much to do besides read the history of the Needle and take lots of pictures. ,Overall, great 360 view of the city. It's a bit pricey without the CityPass, but if you've never been to Seattle and don't plan on coming back often, it's a great option to see the beautiful skyline and the harbor. Why not. Remember to bring a jacket, cause it gets windy up there! ,Note: the photo they have you take before going up the elevator just cracks me up. It's so obviously a green screen with the picturesque landscape background, but I love how cheesy it is!"
"Now, THIS is a library! Floors upon floors of more books and magazines and other stuff, including books on things that I didn't even know had as many books. Take the Armenian section. I had no idea that there was a giant Armenian book section. I knew that LA had a sizeable Armenian population, but still... oh, I wanted to apply for a library card here. But because I live in the San Francisco Bay Area... oh, well."
"Been here so many times. They have made some pretty cool upgrades. In my opinion , it's overly priced. From the tickets to the food and novelty store. It's exciting at first but after a little while you just get bored , wish they had more to it other than Starbucks and the restaurant. Something that makes it much more fun. We were up there for no more than 10-15 minutes . We then got bored and there's nothing else to do besides have coffee and sit. So we left . Over $60 for 10-15 minutes.. Not worth it."
"Been itching to write a review on Yelp and finally, here I am! I went during night time with my wife and had a blast! The view was amazing especially with the Chihuly glass garden right under. Nonetheless, the food is definitely over-rated and therefore I had to take away 1 star :/"
"I've been coming to Seattle for 20 years now and I've always been mortified of the space needle. ,I told myself this is the trip I face my fears. ,We bought tickets for the night scene ""military discount is a plus. -3$ per ticket"". Anyway as it got closer to our 17:30 departure into the heavens I got more and more terrified. You get to take a photo at the base of the needle after your ticket is scanned ""photo can be sent to your email once you reach heaven, or hell depending on how you look at it."" ,Bruh it's a long 41 second ride to the top once in the wonkavator, iSweatergod if there was any chance in hell I could have aborted the mission I'd have taken it. ,Once you reach the top its even worse. I almost shit myself. It was windy that night to top shit off as Seattle always is. But the closer you got to God the more wind you felt. I could feel the nimble needle slightly swaying in the winds.. Cuhz I almost died. I attempted to walk out on the deck around the top.. Yeah clearly that wasn't in the plans because I felt like a newborn baby giraffe. ,All in all the experience was god awful. But Nice all at the same time. ,I've done it once and I will never do it again. ,Lol."
"Who doesn't love a gorgeous view of the city and the water? I bought a joint ticket for the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass Garden & Museum. It was worth every cent. I bought my ticket online and reserved a ""launch time."" I'm not sure how strict they are about their launch times, but my boyfriend and I went up a little early. The elevator is pretty quick and you can see the view from the elevator itself. I purposefully set a launch time for a little bit before sunset, so that I could enjoy the sunlit, sunset, and dusk views. Best idea ever. They also don't force you to leave once you get up top, until closing time.,There's a couple free photo ops. The first is before the elevator, in front of a green screen. The second one is near the elevator exit at the top. The camera is up top, and it captures you with the city skyline in the back. There's stations where you can view your photos and email them to yourself. I honestly really liked my photos.,There's both an indoor and an outdoor area. There's obviously a railing in the outdoor area, but you can still get some gorgeous pictures. There are benches outside and seating inside as well. There's a cafe inside as well as a bar. I ended up going to the bar and getting a couple glasses (or plastic cups) of wine to enjoy while I waited for the sunset. They also had housemade potato chips that were really good too.,I think having dinner there would be absolutely gorgeous. Next time, perhaps!"
"The space needle is 520 feet, the highest observation deck west of mississippi? I wish they could have more entertainment events in there. I went to there on a rainy and cloudy day, so the 360 degree view was not very clear"
"Okay my review of the Space Needle might be a bit askew, as when we got to the box office with full intention of going up, after we saw the price, we didn't! There was a group of 6 of us and for a elevator ride, the price was not worth it. I feel like I have been to the top of truly wonderful structures that didn't cost this. I can't imagine that the view would have been worth the $$ for the group."
"Hello, tourist. Debating what to do today? Would you like to get an overview of the beautiful city you've come to visit? You really have only one decent choice, here.,The lines are long for a ticket, and then you have to wait for a scheduled time to go up - but check out the Chihuly Garden just a few feet away while you await your time. Or stop in the Experience Music Project (EMP) museum, also just a few feet away.,It's crowded on the Space Needle's deck, yes, but... so it goes.,I'd give it a 4 star review for all of this, but then you'd think it's not a must-do thing while you're in Seattle... but it is, so buckle up, and deal with it all, and you WILL have great memories of your day!"
"Wow!  Just wow.  Def high up in the sky, the views from the needle are just magnificent.  You can see all the way to Bellevue and past!  Really nice ride up a clear elevator.  They put 20 ppl in an elevator at a time so try to be one of the last ones in so you will be in the front looking out of the glass!  Haha."
"It is must see attraction: morning and night. If you come before 10am and after 7pm, but not sure when Seattle gets dark, you'll avoid the long long lines. You have to get in line for timed/ scheduled tickets."
"night views are cool. But if you 've been to nyc, chicago, and LA, you know its all the same"
"I like the Space Needle. It's one of the to do things in Seattle.,It's located at the Seattle Center, so you could make a day out of it.  There are ton of other things to do while you are here."
"As the symbol of city, the Space Needle is definitely a must visit place if you ever have the chance to come to Seattle.,I came here around 6:30pm on a Friday night and was surprised to find that there was no line at all. The elevator did take a little while to come down to pick us up. As all of us cramped into the elevator, in just less than one minute, we were already arrived at the top of the viewing area. ,The view is absolutely amazing up there. You get a 360 view, from the downtown on one side to the ocean in another. I do feel like I'm at the top of the world as I overlook at the observation deck. The only thing that I didn't like about the experience was that it was so windy outside so it's hard to appreciate the view. As an advice, I would say bring an extra jacket. If you can't stand the cold, good thing is you can always go back inside and get yourself some drinks at the cafe to keep you warm.,Once you finish, you can take the elevator back and it will stop at the gift shop area. I would also highly recommend to get the combo ticket with the Chihuly Garden. I find that attraction to even offer a better experience."
Definitely a cool place to visit and a must for your trip to seattle!  Arrive early enough to buy a ticket as you basically need a reservation.  You can buy it from the kiosk and then thirty minutes later it will be your turn to go up.  They serve beer and wine at the top.  This is selfie central.  We lucked out and went on a super clear day.  The views were great and we probably spent about an hour there.
"I know this is a landmark type of thing, but I wasn't really impressed. I think the main reason is because I have done the Sears Tower in Chicago which is so much taller. The price to be was a bit pricy, but still a great view. One thing that was really cool is they have big screens with cameras attached and you can control the camera, zoom, ect. On people waking around Seattle"
SO EXPENSIVE!!! I didn't realize that it was going to be so expensive to go up on an elevator and stare at Seattle on top of the building! If they are going to charge so much they might as well offer free coffee or whatever at the top. I mean it was cool seeing it but definitely not worth the money I paid!
"The Space Needle, though a definite must-see if you visit Seattle, is quite overrated.  The romantic landmark that it is is really just a tall building that you pay $28 to go up and down on.  Though I heard that it has breath-taking views at all times of day and that each time of day gives you a different impression each time, I'm not sold.  Let me ride an elevator for a quarter and I'm there :),The surrounding area seems well kept, full of tourists, and a fun place to visit."
"C'mon, for 49 years old The Space Needle can still make you look twice! ,The Space Needle is cool enough that Vegas tried to duplicate the look with their own version - THE STRATOSPHERE. But even adding a roller coaster on top they can't beat the original. ,That's because on a clear day, the 360 degree views of our Emerald City are stunning. Thanks to the Puget Sound, Cascade Mountains, Mt. Rainier, Qwest Field, Safeco, Bellevue skyline and more will take you breath away. ,Taking out of towners? It's not exactly cheap ($18/adult). Skip eating at the top and find a sweet spot at your next stop which SHOULD be *Fremont or *Pike Place Market!"
"We got there late in the day, but it was still a beautiful view. It's definitely something we can check off our bucket list but I don't think it's really worth the $20 per person to get to the top. If we were to go again, we would probably go to the restaurant so at least we would be able to get dessert & drinks for $40 instead of just tickets."
"This is the perfect place to start your sightseeing day in Seattle. We went on a perfectly clear day in Seattle and the views were amazing. From this vantage point you can see all of Seattle area and scope out your next stop. Beautiful views of the bay and Mt. Rainer. Yes most certainly a tourist spot but I would still recommend. They have staff there that will take your photos and e-mail them to you so you can then turn around and e-mail them out.,Buy tickets on line prior for discount to this attraction and glass museum.,Short walk to Olympic Park and the Science Center. We walked from uptown but took public transportation back as metro stop is adjacent."
"It's a Seattle landmark and can be seen all around town basically.  I knew I had to go here and see this while I went on my visit to Seattle.  It was easy getting in and up to the top.  There are two elevators to get up there, one goes faster than the other.  You get a short story from the elevator operator to give you some history.  Once you're at the top, there are displays which give you a history lesson on how and why it was built.  You then can go outside and get a 360 degree view of the city.  It was great because it was a pretty clear day so it was nice.  You can spend as much time as you want while up there and there's a café a floor below.  If you need to go to the bathroom, either go ahead of time or wait until you're downstairs as it gets busy while there.  An awesome view! It shouldn't be missed!"
"I went with my family on a trip. We picked a great time. It was clear and the sun was just setting so we got to see Seattle in both day and night mode. It was a breathtaking view and not for someone afraid of heights. It was beautiful, like looking out on an alien city made of thousands of glimmering lights and sparkling buildings. It truly was worth seeing. I could have done without the mountains of cheesy tourist stuff, but it's inextricable from a tempting attraction, I suppose."
"Not a must do, but if you get here early in the morning, you beat the long lines, and it's not a bad way to start your day as a tourist in the City Of Seattle....."
It was fine but not spectacular. It could use some displays pointing out some of the sites that can be viewed.
"It's a crowded platform with great views and a wait list for views to be had in a hotel concierge bar.  Personally I think the money spent could be better applied to one of the adjacent museums, and do avoid the gift shop -- yikes!"
"Giving it four stars because it's definitely worth seeing. We got up there just as the sun was setting -  aim for this time.  Incredible view of sunset and skyscape. ,The line going up, no problem. Getting back down? Ugh. Took forever (almost as long as a Hertz line). ,Get tickets early, as time slots run out early."
"I want to be honest so here it goes. I thought it was going to be more amazing. Maybe I've seen more spectacular places in my life but this didn't really stand out. ,Everybody has to at least try it so yes I don't take it back. It's really an iconic building so it's good to see every aspect of it. Pretty awesome a lot of the support that keeps the building from shaking buried deep underground. ,I don't think I could do this again unless it was free. The cons about the space needle is the crowds and the bars obstructing the view so you do feel a little caged."
"Note: my review is actually 4.5. I have to deduct a half point from the perfect score because the library smells at times. It smells of homeless people wandering around with their unwashed bodies and stinky feet. GAG.,The stink is especially prominent in the LL3, where the computer stations are. I don't know why homeless people are more able to use computers than read traditional books. There is a man with feet in such bad condition and smell that I'm sure even the most polite pedicurist will turn him away. I've sworn off the computer lab due to this.,Oh, since the computer screens at the lab are protected, some guys feel it safe to view porn! I happen to sit only 3 chairs away from a guy who blatantly stared into his computer screen, shoulder hunched, with strained breathing. At first I thought what a strange person! Then as I walked behind him I glanced to his screen, and it was hardcore porn! YUCK! Library staff, please upgrade your porn firewall. ,Porn and smell aside, I love this library. The collection is the most complete compared to any Los Angeles library, so extensive that sometimes I wish I was a socialite who can stay at home and read books all day long.,The DVD rentals are updated and free (but must be returned within 2 days). If you have children, check out the children section because I think it's absolutely beautiful."
Amazing...Beautiful...refreshing...eyepoping....WOW!!!!  My favorite library ever.
"My first time coming to Seattle, and everyone said the Space Needle was a must.  Sure, it's a tourist trap, but who cares!  The wait wasn't so bad, but in order to eat at the restaurant, you had to make a reservation.  We knew that I'd have to sell a kidney to eat there so we just went to the observation deck.  ,You always hear how Seattle has a lot of clouds and it rains a lot, but it was clear...very clear this day.  Amazing views!  Lots of tourists!  But we spent about two hours at the top, and even broke the piggy bank to eat at the snack bar...LOL!  If you've never been, definitely go up and look around, and hopefully the weather gods will be good to you too!"
"Amazing, it is like a shopping mall except with books.  Huge collection, the only downside is a lot of old ppl dosing off and making all these unpleasant noises.  Once in a while I would drop by and spend a few hrs reading or just walking around and give myself an excuse to dine at the restaurant right next to it."
"In and of itself, this is a great Library. The staff is intelligent and professional. They help you with whatever you need. The architecture is beautiful and grand. ,The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is all the homeless that have discovered this as cool place to hang out.  This can kill the entire experience. Last time I was there, I saw more than one publicly ""grooming"" and cleaning sores.  Makes me kind of scared to touch anything in here.  ,I overheard the security guard say to another patron that the library smelled like wet dog."
"I went to Space Needle on a date, so we decided to go check out the Observation Deck. It was amazing for the fact you could see the entire city of Seattle up there. I also used the big telescope to look around. Ahahahahaha. Don't go up there unless you have someone else paying for you because the entrance price is a bit spendy. Lol! Just kidding but .... Make your own decision!"
"A must when in Seattle! Even though the line may be long for the wait.. Highly recommend it! Great city views and the elevators are pretty awesome with how fast they get you to the top. When you're at the top, you have as long as you'd like! The elevators bring you down whenever you're ready. There's beer, wine, and snacks at the top as well. Also just FYI, only the restaurant rotates!"
Genuine culture in Los Angeles...who knew?
"Open your history book,class ! Now walk thought the pages of where The United States of America got its start, the first capitol . I went here back in the 70's and this past year and was amazed how beautiful and organized everything is. First go to the tourist center to make your free reservation for the free tour. You will be surprised about what you did not know, The Declaration of Independence was not signed on July 4th but a whole month later. Walking from room to room makes you feel your American  roots.After the tour walk around the Colonial neighborhood, go down the street to the church and its cemetery by the corner at the bus stop ,look back and you will see Ben Franklin's grave, go in and you will come face to face with some of the graves of famous Americans."
"It's funny how time changes one's perspective.  You see, I remembered the interior of the Needle as being a lot wider.  I think one of the reasons why it all seems tighter is that the number of tourists visiting has amazingly increased or perhaps the bars and added attractions, ie: technology, is crowding things.  All I know is that I couldn't wait to get out of there!  I think I preferred the simplicity of Needle from the 70's but that just doesn't allow for additional revenue now does it?"
"Free state park attraction inside a major city already chock-full of American History. I would definitely not miss this on a trip to Philadelphia. ,The tour is kind of boring if you have a child's mind like mine, but there are bits I hung on to and focused in on. I would definitely recommend getting there early in the day to get your ticket, then you can focus on other things in the area if you need to wait.,Something I noticed--not once did someone look at our tickets--we didn't even have to prove we had them. So if you're feelin' ballsy, go ahead and walk through the security check without one and see what happens. Yeah, speaking of security check...I had a flask of last night's whiskey in my purse and nobody said anything. I could have been gettin' my drink on where Bennie Franklin signed up for freedom."
"If you visit Seattle you have to visit here, make sure it's a clear day as it offers you an amazing view of the skyline of Seattle and puget sound. They have some great multimedia integrations with touchscreen panels,  selfie cams and plenty of interactive items to keep everyone happy. You can also time you visit right as the crowds come and go so if it's too busy when you visit consider going to something like the EMP museum until the line drops down a bit. It's a little expensive but it's a nice thing to do and everytime I see it I think of scifi TV show Dark Angel...."
"It cost a bit less than 20 bucks for a great view with unlimited access. Worth it. For a ticket to the space needle you can a ride up in the elevator and then you can stay up there for as long as you want. While on top, this is a lounge area for you to get drinks, snacks, and rest. Bad bad for a tourist attraction specific to Seattle. ,I would get there a bit early compared to your ticket time since there can be a bit of a wait. I came here for ""golden hour"" and I ended up waiting in line for about 45 mins. It was totally worth it though. ,As you approach the elevator area, they check your bags and take your photo on one of those cheesy green screens. You do get a digital copy of it for free though. So get your smug on I guess! ,On the observation desk you get a great 360 view around the city. If you are trying to take photos be warned there will be a lot of people and you will probably get photo bombed. But on the plus, you can get strangers to take photos for you. ,Also, as a photographer, I would not come here to shoot out into the city. There are better spots, and you probably want to get the space needle in your frame anyways. ,Overall, this is a great spot to visit if you are in Seattle. Also, the glass museum is right next door, and you should definitely check that out. You can even get a package deal for both tickets and save about 5 bucks."
"The history behind the space needle is amazing!  The rest of the experience is ok.  You can get a 360º view of Seattle, see Puget Sound, and everything else.  Is it worth the price of admission?  Short answer is no.  I wouldn't come back again unless I was showing friends around but after they see the prices, they would probably pass as well.  All the touchscreens on the observation deck were being hogged and people would cut in front and spend even more time on them.  We went right when they opened.  I can see how this place could be fun and informative but for me, I'd recommend passing and spending it on other experiences."
"I went on a weeknight right around sunset. This was a great time to visit because it was empty. There were no lines and no wait at the elevator. The view from the top was nice as the sun was setting. I don't usually pay for tourist attractions like this but I was showing a friend around. It was worth one visit. The tickets are $18. Not too bad, but not worth going more than once."
not worth the money. 22 dollars to visit. ridiculous. Go to the sky observatory and get your moneys worth there. A lot taller and better view. don't waste your money on the needle.14 bucks for the sky observatory.
"Not what I expected, but still something you have to do once. We had a city pass and went in the day and then at night. Id recommend going at sunset! So pretty and romantic!"
$14 to go up an elevator into a giftshop. I've seen better views from hotel windows.
"I mean, how can one ignore a landmark attraction like the Space Needle when visiting Seattle?  It would be akin to avoiding the Eiffel Tower in Paris (okay, it's not quite the same ... but work with me).  The attraction is well run and organized, and located within a complex of other attractions which include the Chihuly Glass Museum and Seattle Children's Museum.  I highly recommend arriving early (I saw a very long line wrap around a spiral platform at the base of the museum by noon) or have a reservation for the Sky City Restaurant (which includes your ticket up to the viewing platform).  The view of the city from the top of the Space Needle was pretty spectacular and provides a terrific orientation to the geography of the metro area."
"Hard to review because I didn't go up it.,Just looked at it at night.,And it was pretty cool."
"Space Needle experience was cool. The view was cool. The elevator ride up and down was cool.  The selfie camera was cool. The technology there that allows you to be entertained and obtain some memories were cool. ,$21 bucks for people will selfie sticks coming close to hitting your face because they had to be at the same spot you are because they need to take a selfie at that specific spot, not so cool. Maybe 15 bucks."
"A must go in Seattle. It was scary but there are beautiful sights.,The elevator ride was the worst because it was shaking the whole time (41 second ride). ,-a must go,-amazing views,-open most of the day"
A fun place to visit.  Always a good time.  Love the self paying stands so you don't have to wait in line.  I feel like there is more stuff at the top than there was the last time I was there (coffee shop).  Gift store at the base.  A full 360 view of the Seattle area.  Worth a stop even though it is touristry.    Discount tickets for seniors.
"Great views of Seattle and the surrounding areas up here.  There are also some great photo opportunities.  I actually did not know it was that high.  It's real windy and cold up there so be sure to bring a jacket.  There is a restaurant upstairs and a gift shop down on the main floor., Scariest thing: the elevator ride up and down."
"Jumping George Jetson!,If you're in Seattle, you have to go. Once.  It's the city icon. ,It's corny.  It's hokey. It's expensive.  And it's GREAT!,The Needle is quintessential Seattle.  It's their Empire State Building.  You've got to do it once.,The views of Seattle are terrific, but you don't go up the SN for the views.  You go to say you've done it.,The Needle together with the *monorail* are what 1962 Seattle thought the future would look like.  It's so unbelievably quaint.  ,You keep looking for George Jetson.,And in fact he's right around the corner.,Practical info:  we were there in high season, but there was no wait at 11:00 am on a weekday.  You go up for free if you eat in the restaurant, but we couldn't get reservations.  Make them wa-a-a-y in advance.,The gift shop is jammed with funky retro merchandise."
"Gorgeous, gorgeous view! I'm so happy I went at night and on a Thursday, as there was no line.,It is about $22 to get in if you buy it at the door, but only $18 if you purchase it in advance. It's right next to Chihuly (the glass exhibit) and I believe you can view both of them for $36 on their website.,We were welcomed with a free picture when we entered. You head upstairs and you'll find these screens where you can choose different Space Needle backgrounds/city views and have it sent to your email.,It is freeeeeezing up there, so I suggest gloves, thick socks and a nice cozy jacket. The view is so breathtaking, you almost don't mind the cold. If you're able to score a wristlet for your phone so that you can take pictures outside of the glass door, I would recommend it. I wish I knew and had that as the pictures would look better.,Yelp says they close at midnight, but I believe they close at 9:30pm M-Thurs and Friday/Sat they close at 10:30pm!"
"What can I say? If you're a tourist this is a must-see at least once in a lifetime. If you're a local you should be embarrassed to admit you haven't gone. But be forewarned that it's overpriced and with $30 you could buy a lot of other stuff. Go once, take photos and check it off your list. We know you came to Seattle to see it!"
"Being that I was born and raised in Seattle and saw the Space Needle everywhere I went, actually riding up the thing never seemed necessary to me.,Although you can probaaably call me a little biased as my trip up didn't cost me a thing, I am well aware as to how expensive it is. I was invited up for dinner in the Skycity Restaurant. After hearing the endless complaints of how expensive and yet average the food was, I wasn't expecting much. Honestly though?,I don't know what the heck everyone was talking about.,Staff was extremely friendly, and yes, it's pricey, but if you're going to eat in a restaurant ""in the sky"" that's constantly turning and is a tourist spot, what did you expect? McDonald's? Jeez. I ordered the chicken. My best friend and her family ordered beef tenderloin, the agno...ravioli-esque dish and I forgot the last one. But we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. And their fruit smoothies! Yum. For dessert, we got the cobbler and the Dutch chocolate cake. Again, delicious! My friend and her dad were playfully fighting over the last pieces of the cake. The Orbit desert also seems extremely popular! [At least, I think that's what it's called!] They use Dry Ice to create a cool effect when they serve you what is just essentially ice cream. We loved watching the expressions on people's faces and the excitement. That really added to the calm atmosphere.,And the view!,I've been in the Pearl Tower in Shanghai that does the same thing, but is much larger [it's a buffet] and has a small area for you to actually stand on next to the tables to look down. But nothing beats the view of Seattle night lights and the water and the blue of the sky. We didn't get the usual stunning orange/red/blue sunset, but it was still beautiful. So if you're lucky enough to catch one of those [which happen all the time during the summer], it's well worth the trip up.,I'd say, considering it's not like you're going up everyday, it's well worth it to grab a bite there. They also have a mini-cafe like thing on observation, so you can grab a snack and sit with a bud or a loved one.,Oh, and after observing last night--ladies, it's pretty windy. If you're wearing a skirt/dress, be prepared to hold down your dress like Marilyn Monroe."
"Thank you to Maria who suggested a wonderful restaurant to me. She rocked! A beautiful view, don't miss the Space Needle!"
"Purchased City Pass to take out my teenage brother included are 2 tickets for day time use and 2 tickets for night time use. With City Pass you get to skip the lines which can get long during the daytime summer months., I can't give a full review since i haven't been to the restaurant yet, just the Cafe and Observation deck but so far so groovy. Standing up there during a warm breezy day/night and smelling the salty air is very calming. You can see wonderful views of the city, the sound, and on a clear day the mountains. At night the lights of the city sparkle all around you.  Be sure to get the complimentary pictures upon entering and at the observation deck as mementos just remember to scan your ticket and email them to yourself before you leave. Try the virtual tour of Seattle on the interactive touch screens standing around. You can stay for as long as you want and wander the decks and try all the exercises on the giant floor to ceiling touch screens. It is a bit pricy to go up and to eat but then again is IS a tourist attraction. ,I have seen ALOT of reviews unhappy about transportation. If you are driving just shell out for the over priced parking there at the Seattle Center. ,There are other options as well. From Westlake Center you can take the Monorail less than $5 for a round trip adult pass. If you are coming from Seatac Airport or anywhere along the Lightrail train just jump on the train and transfer over to the monorail at Westlake center also only $5 for an all day pass. I am local and the Monorail is always how i get to Seattle Center it drops you off right in front the the space needle and runs until 11pm. Actually I think i'm going to go write a Monorail review now. ,Have a great time at the Space Needle!"
"The Space Needle is Seattle's way of showing off to the world. It is a complex system of elevators, floors and a great skydeck. ,Having been built for the 1962 World's Fair, Seattle worked hard to build the needle. You can easily access the top as I did. There's even a restaurant. CityPass gives you two visits.,You can the Space Needle by monorail, since it's in the Seattle Center.,In getting in, you walk up a walkway and then they take your tickets. Then you board and elevator, which is also how you'll get down. At the top floor, they have a bar and coffee. They have interactive exhibits and a little history. They created SpaceBook and take you back to an age before Watergate where people were optimistic about the future. I,At the deck which is basically just accessed like a door to a balcony, you can see the Emerald City in all it's finest. Many of the buildings are fairly clear, even at night. ,At $21, it can be a little expensive. The needle itself has the glory, not so much what's inside the building. The view is also what sets this apart. ,Ultimately, this is what's on the postcards.,So smile and see this icon."
"If you were to take an out of town guest straight from the airport to downtown Bellevue, they would probably think they were in Seattle .. for a moment.  Then they would have a moment where they go ""Wait, where is the Space Needle?"",That right there folks, is why the Space Needle is Seattle's skyline icon.,You will notice that a few weeks prior to the post date of this review, the top part of the Space Needle was painted a bright orange.  Why?  It's for the 50th anniversary celebration of the Space Needle.  The color is called ""Galaxy Orange"" and it was the original color.  There is your Seattle trivia Q&A for the day!,Sure, visiting the Space Needle is a touristy thing to do.  It's also a great place to be on New Year's Eve (in the nearby area).  If you visit the top of the needle or the restaurant, you'll get a great view of the city.  Of course you'll stand there looking over the Seattle skyline and go ""Wait, where is the Space Needle?  Oh riiiight..."",The restaurant itself - well that's whole different review.  At least you don't have to pay to get up there to eat.  Of course they do have an order minimum just in case you thought you could get ""cute"" and go up there for a beverage just to save the cost of the elevator ride!"
"Love it. Just...love it.,Parking on the weekend is cheap and nice, but two hours before work gets out will run ya about $4, ah well. It's a small price to pay for the beauty of this library. It has subterranean floors with gigantic, ridiculously gigantic marble (?) pillars and high flying art chandeliers. If you get vertigo easily (not that I do....................) I'd recommend the elevators or test your tolerance by using the escalators. ,I find that the catalog computers are seemingly few and far between, but they are there! There is a slight creepiness factor if you've got boobs (woman boobs only folks!) due to the large percentage of homeless men that hang out there during the day, but nothing to really put you on alert thankfully!,Be sure to check out the watery head at the front of the library on the other side of the fountain...very neato. :),Other jems that I learned of today - a neato occult section in religion (How to fend off Psychic Vampires!)  and be sure to check out the massive drawers of picture clippings up in the art section!"
Beautiful library has every book I need perfect place for me to get away from home and study
"This place is basically a homeless shelter during the day, but it's a very nice building with nice landscaping. I just don't really like being on the inside - everything seems grimy.,The cafe in there with the Panda is ok. Smells funky, seats feel dirty. What can you do?,I've never actually borrowed books from here - I should. Very nice building."
"Fantastic view to all sides of Seattle and up to Canada, Mount Rainier (if wetter's good). ,Friendly staff but the costs are quite high with currently 23,10. I know that other cities charge likely the same. You get free digital picture from downstairs or from the top (please watch to not request the pic directly when you arrive the top. It may be blocked to get the pic from above."
"I love this place. First off, the art deco architecture is beautiful. Take a walk around and make sure to check out the children's reading room, which is wood paneled and features a beautiful mini stage where they perform little skits and plays for the kiddies. The library has a huuuugeee collection, almost to the point where it is overwhelming. Seriously, every book I've ever wanted has been there. No need for me to go to Borders or Barnes and Noble and buy the book for 20+ bucks. I wished I lived closer because I would go there multiple times a week, but when I go there on the weekend, the parking is only 1 dollar with validation, and it's right underneath the library. Can't beat that deal!"
"This is my new office space while I freelance for a bit!,Will defiantly be here Mon-Fri in the arts section, its great... SO great, It's my first day working here today and I feel so studious.... Ideas for projects are popping like caps from my head and I have plenty of reading material around to expand my mind.,Awesome garden outside to relax in on my breaks, will be popping out to the Moca for some contemporary art inspiration for sure and the building itself is a maze of different entries, galleries, corridors and rooms to explore.,Internet is FREE and superfast, always a seat and restrooms on every floor, I'm loving it.,Back to work :)"
"I recommend you going at night!!!! 100x better than going during the day. 360 view, Starbucks/small cafe inside. And fun facts on a wall. GREAT for the kids! Even got a free picture emailed too us!"
"Seattle... space needle, gotta do it but actually thought this was a little pricey for what it was.  $21 for the elevator ride.  My world traveler friend told me that the glass museum next door was much more interesting. Have to hit that next time!"
Love this place!  A must see for locals and tourists.  HUGE Books on CD and DVD collection
"Great place to visit to get a sense of American History. The line for the Liberty Bell is long, but it does move rather quickly and you gotta visit it if you are in Philly. Lots of pretty photo op areas inside and out."
"I've been to the Space Needle a couple times, the RnR Seattle marathon ends right beneath it but I've never been to the observation deck until just recently. My boyfriend said I definitely have to go up. It's the Space Needle so that we did! but my golly $21 bucks a pop to go to the top. I guess it's the same everywhere Empire State Building, Willis Tower - but hey it's all for fun right? So we went up!,Bought our tix via the kiosks below which made the most sense, I'm still not entirely sure why anyone would wait in a line 4x the length of the line for the kiosks to interact and perform the same transaction with a human. You may also purchase online or via their ap for $19 ahead of time.,It was 130P and our tickets were for 2P this gave me time to lust over the Chihuly glass garden sculptures and gift shop. I almost didn't want to go up any longer and then wanted to go to the glass exhibit. We were on a tight schedule and lucky for me, there's Yelp :) where I was able to view many gorgeous pics of the glass and even had an awesome view on the way down of the outdoor garden and greenhouse.,The top was fun, great views on a great sunny and 75 degree weather day. Not super crowded and I really liked their interactive displays showing how many people have visited and how many miles they've traveled to get there.,Must visit, at least once! I finally have."
"An historic can't miss in a city full of historic can't misses.  If you're just in town for a few days, work it in along with the Liberty Bell (right next store) and maybe even the Art Museum.  If you live in Philly, why not make a visit during one of its several events during the year.  Pops on Independence has been an annual tradition for at least the last few years can be loads of fun (as long as the weather agrees)."
"I think it's super overrated. Yes you get to see the beautiful view from up above. That's priceless however it's outrageously crowded. You can't even enjoy it. You can't walk because of the crowds. Minimal seating area. Long long long wait to come back down. Gift shop is over priced. Not a fan of this. Head over the ""SKY TOWER OBSERVATORY""!"
"CITY PASS attraction- 2 visits!,Great for a daylight visit and a sunset or nighttime view too!,Went on a Saturday and we must have lucked out with our timing.,The wait for the elevator (both ways) wasn't bad at all.,The view was lovely.,I had hoped to take panoramic shots, but it was impossible with all the railings.  Ah well.,Of course this is a must-do while visiting Seattle!"
"This has been one of the landmarks I be been wanting to see up and personal ... Even getting close to this site I will be satisfied.   We came here after we walked downtown Seattle near pike place.   Got here knowing that this will be the only time we will see this landmark while we are here,  it was about 9pm and the it was well lighted .  It was beautiful and the surrounding park complemented the colors .   This will be  a short review foe a short visit.  I will probably update this review whenever we come back and have a full tour here in this beautiful emerald city of Seattle.   By the way, Seattle reminds me of how San Francisco is constructed ... Thy have similarities.  Don't know but that's just my opinion."
"This 5 star review is for the Space Needle Valet.  These guys saved me the other day!,I pulled in the valet line to drop someone off at the Needle.  Turned the car off for a minute, got back in and my battery was dead with NO warning.  The valet team came to my rescue.  They immediately came over, popped the hood and had one of their coworkers pull his car around to jump start it for me.  One of the guys previously worked for Les Schwab and gave me their info and directions to the shop.  I went straight there and everything was taken care of.  It's not every day that people go out of their way to help you when you're stranded, but these guys saved the day."
"Aside from the market, this was my favorite spot in Seattle. The line to get in was stupid long, with an estimated wait time of over 2 hours!!! Luckily, the bf and I had CityPasses, so we virtually skipped the line into the MUCH shorter VIP line. We still had to wait around 30 minutes, but it was completely worth it. Going up in the elevator you hear some people hold their breath as you see the city dropping beneath you, so just giggle and enjoy the ride! We went up right before dusk in July (7 PM...ish?) and stayed until almost 10! The view of the city and sound during sunset was incredible and was even better at night. Seating inside is super limited, but we were able to snag a table and watch the sunset, then circled the outside deck once more at night.,CityPass lets you go up twice within 24 hours so be sure to take advantage!!"
"It's hard to believe this building is celebrating 50 years. What a wonderful spot!,We missed the restaurant and bar as it was a Monday and the bar closes at 9PM. However, the coffeeshop and observation deck were open. At this time of the year, sunset is about 9:45. Wow! what a beautiful outing on a wonderful sunny day.,It's fun to come back to Seattle, ride the Monorail and enjoy the Space Needle! I look forward to visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass House down below the Needle which was slated to open the week after this visit.,The lines were nominal on this particular Monday."
This is a must see when visiting Seattle. Grab a beer at the top! Obviously has amazing views
"I really wanted the Space Needle to be a magical, on-top-of-the-world experience; I really did. But it wasn't. They just did not do a good job of managing the crowds. We walked aaaalll the way through the line at the base and went straight up the elevator to the top. Where there were TONS of people. Too many people. Waaaay too many people. There were so many people that we could barely get out the door to go outside. You're constantly tripping over people and there's no room to take a decent picture of the scenery. Even when we came back after dark, it was still really crowded.,They need to make people wait on the ground for a little while in order to help with the crowding. I wouldn't have minded an extra 15-20 minutes if I thought it would improve my experience topside.,We ate lunch at the little cafe up there. The food was actually pretty good. Clam chowder, hot paninis, even beer and wine. I didn't have anything there that I disliked. But there was a serious lack of seating. Not enough spaces for all the people who wanted to eat.,The Space Needle is definitely a Seattle must-do, but don't get your hopes up that it's going to be all magical and romantic. You probably have to go to the restaurant (which we didn't try because we never even found how to get there) for that."
"This is a must go see, it has great views of the city of Seattle. You can walk outside atop the needle on the deck and take many panoramic views/pictures. The elevator ride up has glass windows to take pictures, which is very cool. There is a starbucks, a restaurant, restrooms and tables to sit and enjoy the views."
Went for breakfast this morning near the space needle found something closer same owner yes !!!  Space Needle  breakfast awesome from Chef Andrew fancy waffles on the go yummy great taste !!!!!!  Try it I highly recommend!!! Great prices
"The Space Needle is something I have wanted to visit ever since I was a child.  We finally made our way to it today, and it was awesome! The weather was gross and rainy, but even with the fog you could still see a lot.  ,I'm really afraid of heights, but unlike the Calgary Tower the Space Needle feels much more stable.  There isn't much to do at the top besides the gorgeous view, but you can get some Starbucks, beer, and wine. The observation deck is pretty neat too.,The staff at the gift shop at the base of the tower were really friendly, and got me a new light up space needle when they found out mine wasn't working.,Overall, if you are in Seattle, you must check out the Space Needle."
"My husband and I spent a good time at the top of the tower, the view of Seattle was just so nice! ,We decided to have dinner at the space needle restaurant, the decoration and the concept of this restaurant is totally different and kinda romantic, the music was perfect that night and enjoyable. ,We ordered seafood and it was great!! The service was OK!,we waited quite time for our meals but it worth it, the food was so delicious. ,U need to know that this place is not cheap, we paid around 60$ bucks for our dinner.,But it is good for an special occasion :)"
"Yeah, it's expensive for a quick ride up to the top and things get old pretty fast after you make a couple of orbits up on the top deck, but you still must come here at least once in your life. I mean who goes to Seattle and doesn't go to the Space Needle? ,Unfortunately, I've been here more than once and the novelty has worn off (especially at around $20/pp for a ride up). Upon entering, you follow the path to the elevator and they'll stop your party for a group shot that you can buy later if you want. Then you get the elevator with everyone else and as you go up, the employee/host will spout out info about what used to be over there and there until you get to the top. ,Doors open and you're on your own. It's nice to take in the views from such height and the observation deck is a wonderful space for people who haven't been before.,Gift shop downstairs too and I actually got quite a few random things from there. I'll see if I can find them.  ,Treat yourself like royalty; you owe it to yourself to take in this majestic view at least once in your life!"
"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Today was my second time going, and based off the first time, I was really excited to show my family from out of town. We live in Vancouver, but thought Seattle and their famous Space Needle were worth seeing. So wrong.,I didn't have any problems last time. Now I realize that's because I didn't have to deal with the horrible staff. We waited in line to get tickets, and of course that's okay. But when we got to speak with the girl at the ticket booth, things went downhill fast. Her attitude was terrible. She looked like she didn't want to be there, and she was rude. Instead of asking, ""Pardon me?"" If she couldn't understand, it was this really pissy ""What?"",My brother is visually impaired, and my parents just wanted to find out if his admission would be free, or a courtesy pass. She was abrupt, didn't smile. Such contempt really. There's no problem if there wasn't anything available, but she could have told us in a way other than sounding like she was bored and snobby.,She tossed my dad's card carelessly at him through that metal or steel tray below the plexiglass, and at that point he started getting upset. I saw it all, and my mom asked her if next time, she could be more courteous. The girl didn't even try. No sorry, no, ""What can I do to help you?"" ,So, I told her I wanted the manager. She smirked and just pointed to the left. Kept pointing. Didn't move to bring him to where she was. I was so mad that I dropped the b-word at her. He wasn't any help either. You know what he said? ""Whoa whoa whoa!"" And made a big deal like I pointed a gun at her or threatened to kill her. Jesus Christ. ,I got very angry for a reason, and instead of being a true manager and thinking of the customer, he said he would call security and have me escorted out. I was ANGRY. Newsflash, people get angry, and its managers like him and workers like her who make things worse. If I'm pounding my fists on the glass, FINE. If I've threatened to hurt the staff, FINE. But I did NOT. And he had no right to threat me like some kind of terrorist. He did nothing but side with his careless worker. I work in service. I know first hand, even if a customer is really angry and agitated, we are still obligated to make sure we provide good customer service. You say, I UNDERSTAND that you're angry. Please calm down, wait here, and we can talk. But no. It's, ""I'm calling security!"" As if I'd done something SO bad, terrible and unspeakable, ,He said, she was saying ""What?"" because she couldn't hear us. And he said HE couldn't hear us either. So, you can't hear us but apparently you heard EVERYTHING I said earlier? Full of lies and excuses. Customer service? It's a joke. We were so put off that we asked to refund the $219 we paid. As we left he sarcastically said,""Have a nice day."" ,Oh, and meanwhile, her? I could see her mouthing the words, ""Oh my god, really?"" Shaking her head. Wow. She obviously didn't learn a thing. The only thing she's learned is that she can continue with her terrible attitude, and her manager will back her up.,Your attraction only cares about the money it rakes in. It's really obvious that all your staff don't care, and it's being condoned. ,I'm not coming back, but I know that doesn't matter. I hope eventually, you'll hire people who don't hate their jobs as much as your current staff do. Or at least train them to be less snobby and cranky. Maybe then you wouldn't have upset customers like me, dropping the b-bomb because your staff are so careless and callous. ,If you're going to write back and tell me it was MY fault and that management ""did what thry could"", save it. I got really angry for a reason, and your staff made me look like a criminal."
"What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Seattle?  Microsoft?  Amazon?  Rain?  NO! It's the space needle.  Do you know why?  Because it's freaken awesome.  ,But it sounds like most of the people on here disagree with me.  People seem to think that it was something more than a super long building that lets you go to the top and look around.  What did you expect?  To go to space?  To meet aliens? To fly?,Yes, it is expensive.  No, it's not the tallest building in Seattle.  Or the second tallest, or the third or fourth or fifth (I think it's the 7th, but could be wrong). But it's still one of the most recognizable landmarks in the United States, and definitely in Seattle.  So why complain?,If you're visiting Seattle for the first time (as I was), don't listen to the other reviews and avoid this place, you'll regret it.  All you friends and family will ask if you went to the Space Needle, and if you didn't, they'll look at you like you're crazy.  Pay the money, ride the elevator, see the top, read the history (which is actually really interesting), and just enjoy being an unabashed tourist!"
"This is a must-see for first-timers to the Seattle area. Not only is it the dominant feature of Seattle's skyline, but the views are awesome. ,We bought the day and night tickets for $26 each (regular single admission is $19). It was a good choice. While we enjoyed the day views, the night views were just amazing. (And the Space Needle is a quick and easy monorail ride from downtown),The lines moved pretty quickly to get up to the top which was nice. There is a cafe and seating inside the observation deck and it was a casual atmosphere where you really were encouraged to sit and take it all in. They also piped in a lot of Sleepless in Seattle-type music which really lent to the ambiance (especially at night). ,Wasn't too hard to find spaces to enjoy the view outside. People seemed pretty polite and respectful. ,This year is the 50th anniversary of the 1962 World's Fair so a lot of the historical stuff there is related to that. I wish there would have been more World's Fair-themed souvenirs, but the pickings were slim (the elevator going down dumps you off right in the gift shop - so convenient ;),Make sure to walk around outside and enjoy the views of the Space Needle from below, too."
"I skipped the super touristy Space Needle the last time I was in Seattle so this time I figured it was time to check it out.  I wasn't expecting to be too impressed, after all, rooftop bars and observation decks are a dime-a-dozen since the 1962 World's Fair. However, I really enjoyed my time at the top and spent over 40 minutes milling about and sipping my beer.  I purposely picked a clear day to go up as I was craving views of Mt. Rainier.  The sights were great and the beer was tasty and not too crazy expensive at $6.  I like that you can buy a ticket for a certain time and then mill about the gift shop up until that point.  Yeah, I bet they like that too.  It was a good way to get an extra $9 out of me."
"Majestic views. a spinning sensation. a free photo-op in front of a cheesy backdrop before you ascend. what's not to like?,With the outdoor view, the Seattle Space Needle is a revolving, lower West-Coast version of the Empire State Building. it's not  nearly as pricey, and the lines aren't as bad. I was lucky enough to hit a beautiful sunny, clear, winter day, and I waited about 40 minutes to ascend.,Along with great views and opportunities for photos, the Space Needle offers a coffee shop and informational interactive screens about all the neighborhoods. When I got tired of the views, I became an expert on all things Seattle. Now someone needs to pay me to be a tour guide the next time I visit!"
"We had tourists from out of town so we took them up the needle. Booking online is a few bucks cheaper, but we wanted to get our tickets together and we got the King County resident discount which you can only get in person (you show your ID and your ticket is $16, as opposed to $19 online or $21 onsite). ,We didn't have much of a line at all, and it was on the weekend, so that was pretty good. It's only 40 seconds to the top, and the elevator operator/guide packs some pretty nifty trivia in at that time. We also went on a really clear day so apparently we could see all the way to Canada or something, and we got some spectacular views of Mt. Rainier to the south, and Mt. Baker to the north.,As far as big towers with observation decks go, it was pretty much what I expected. There's the outside bit, the inside bit with the snack bar, and some random information about the needle. I do like the ""voyeur-cam"" things you can play with, where you can watch people going about on the street.,But yeah, at least I can say I've gone up it now. Whee!"
"As I was peering at the Space Needle, I could not help but to ask myself, ""Am I missing something?"". Don't get me wrong, the building is impressive, the view is phenomenal, but it was NOT worth $20 bucks. It looked cooler from the plane!"
"Endless amounts of books, I am happy.  The librarians are helpful and tons of security--a bit odd but good I guess."
"Perhaps, it's because I'm older or walking distance to this particular branch or maybe it's both.  However, I don't believe that I've actually gone to a library as often, borrowed as many book, and remarkably return them as I have in the two months that I've live in Downtown LA.  My bookworm friends are so proud.,True for this particular branch:, - Tons of PCs available for use to go on the internet or write up your report., - They have a remarkable collection, including dvds and other media., - It's HUGE, so you'll always find a QUIET spot., - Spaces are available for presentation use.,True for all branches:, - The new e-book and email system is remarkable.  Whatever books, dvds, etc. that your local library does not have, they you can borrow them from other branches without going there.  You can make a request and the item you request will be shipped to the branch nearest you and you may also return them near you too.  If it is not immediately available, you are emailed whenever it is."
"This library is the rockface. Seriously.. it's awesome.,Great place to hang out at if you're waiting for something to be processed at some consulate or embassy downtown.,You don't need to be an LA resident to get a library card here. Just a form of ID, some bill or envelope with your name and address on it. You can even get a courtesy card for 6 months if you don't have any proof of residence to show your ID corresponds with your address.  ,There's a nice internet center that you can browse up to 2 hours if you have a library card. You can also word process and print for $0.25 a piece. There's also 15 minute terminals you can use if you don't.,Floors of books too. Pretty fricking awesome."
"What an Amazing Experience! ,Visiting Seattle this was a location we had to visit and so should you. We pre bought our tickets online and printed them out or had them on my phone but you can also buy them at the front door the day off at the same price. I purchased the day & night pass so I can go twice within the 24 hour time frame, once for a day view and the other for a night view. The line does get long do you might want to plan you trip here with a little extra time before and after, each ticket does come with what they say a free photo but you get them ALL for free though email. On the way in they take one group photo of your party and they will give you a ticket and you can send that to your email once you get inside and use the photo viewer to see it and send it (just scan your ticket). Inside space needle they also have 2 cameras that you can scan that same ticket and attach more photos that you take from the top and outside view. At the top they have snacks, drinks, beer, and etc that you can purchase, They also have a spinning dinner restaurant that you can sit and enjoy the views to enjoy. Hope this helps a little and enjoy your visit!"
"I love this place. It is almost holy to me. The architecture and gardens are something to behold, but inside... so many books! Plus there's art! Plus there's a chic little boutique! You can take a tour. They also will hold books for you. You do not even need to call. Just log on. Oh, and ALOUD! I saw Michael Connelly here. The only drawback are the bathrooms which are kind of scary, and the smelly homeless people using it as a place to sleep. My nieces loves it, too. They have a fantastic children's library with shows every Saturday."
Short wait times and courteous service.
"When I was in college like over 10 years ago, this was a really great place to come and look at books, study, stare at the ceiling and the architecture, etc etc.  Huge place you can get lost in with lots of books and reference materials.,This place has really gone downhill since those days.  Yes, there are homeless everywhere and on every floor.  The bathrooms are just a mess.  Each room I've went to on the lower levels reeks of urine when you walk in (then the ventilation kicks in).  ,I understand it's a public library.  But this is also a public health issue.  I'm not even sure if the chair and workstation I'm writing this on is sanitary.,I will say that Wednesdays they have a Farmer's Market and street food right outside the library.  Yum!  $5 for a small box of cous cous and tandoori chicken!  So one extra star for that.  I really don't want to give this library a bad review.  But this place reeks!,I'm going to crawl back behind the Orange Curtain now."
"The space needle is pretty cool, typically touristy thing to do. Does get pricey but it's pretty cool Cuhs they do take your pic and give you a free digital copy. They bathrooms were pretty gross and the line to us them is kinda ridiculous but over all it's beautiful with a beautiful sight"
"Wow this place is overpriced, but if you go on a nice clear sunny day it's worth the 360 degree view of awesomeness!,The line is sometimes huge! It might help to call ahead or go at an odd time.,Be sure to check out their gift shop it has some really interesting souvenirs and art. I love just looking at everything while your out of town guests buys random items that all say Seattle on it!,While at Seattle Center be sure to check out its' other offerings from the Armory for great food, to the huge fountain."
"Although I live in Santa Monica, I come here often.  The architecture is stunning, the collection is superb, and the staff is easy-going.  If you want to print something on a computer, it can be challenging because it's hard to nab a computer and once you do, it's rarely clean.  That said, I come here for books.  I can print elsewhere.  If you come, make sure to walk over to The Last Bookstore on Spring St.  It's a great experience as well."
Historic and captivating..if you like History. I DO!
"Day time: ,Awesome view! From the top! Chilly at times on the side facing the water. Hours are convenient! Must stop by there if you are visiting Seattle! They have an annual pass for $39 for people who are near by.,Night time: ,Pretty sights of the city lights! Especially on the downtown side.,There's a mini cafe and a bar on the viewing level that have a decent selection. Be prepared for rain because the viewing deck outside has no coverage and rain will catch you by surprise!! Don't go on Saturday and Sunday! Super crowded. I went on Friday afternoon and it was already a workout to maneuver through the top!  ,There's also many touch displays with cameras so you can look further into the city which is really cool! On the east side there is a camera where you can put your ticket in and it will snap a picture of you! Don't forget to do that before you leave and email the picture to yourself! ,Enjoy!"
We paid $1.50 for the advance tour but almost lost our reservation because we showed up 30 mins prior to the tour time. The hall itself was very cool and worth checking out but the tour which lasted almost 35 minutes was a waste of time since we had to listen to a park ranger provide a history of the revolution and how we have forgotten some of the folks that helped write the constitution. Rating this three stars because I would have preferred to opt out of the 7th grade history lesson and have 20 minutes of my time back.
"Since it's such an iconic landmark, it's a must to visit for all Seattle tourists. The elevator ride up is pretty cool since the panes are all glass and you get to see outside. The views from the top are good and the fact you get to be outdoors for the views is even better. However, the observation deck is only 520 feet so it's not the tallest structure in Seattle. Personally, I thought the views were much better from the Sky View Observatory (at the Columbia Center) since the building was so much taller (902 feet) than the Space Needle. If you plan on visiting both the Chihuly Garden and Glass and the Space Needle, I recommend buying the package admission as you will save a few dollars."
"Its certainly a place to check off your bucket list, but ridiculously expensive to go up to the observation deck. With tax, it was $22 per person. Normally more than that during the day (we went up late at night).,Check it off the list, but save up for it."
"View was nice at night but I couldn't identify much from that height. The elevator personnels were pleasant. ,Dinner was okay.... Appetizers were decent but main courses were super salty. No balance whatsoever. Duck fries weren't that great. All were wayyyyy overpriced for the portions n quality.  ,I felt like they should've brought my sis )with her bachelorette sash) a free dessert or something for our celebration, was a $700 dinner after all.... But nothing."
"Tourist trap but every city has one. Adds a certain je ne c'est quoi to the skyline that just screams SEATTLE in da' house. Lines tend to get long on bright days. Its Seattle so you may have guessed the reasons. Best part is that once you are feeling sleepless, some great hang-out joints are just a short walk away. A bit of a longer walk away is my favorite Top Pot location, Dahlia Bakery, Original Starbucks, Pink Door and a sugarload of other places that I'll review in due time."
The experience didn't match the price tag. Beautiful views worth experiencing once in your life. I think the best way to experience the space needle would be through the restaurant.
"I mean, it's a landmark so you should go up if you have the time but I'm not sure how amazing it is. I didn't have any expectations going in and it happened to be a slow night about an hour prior to close so there wasn't a wait, parking fees and/or annoying crowds but the price of admission was a bit steep: $22 per adult. Yikes! It's only 500 ft tall, built in the 60s and the exhibits were kind of lackluster. This is Seattle, not Tokyo. You're likely only to spend a half hour up there MAX. If I had to wait in a long line to go up, it'd be disappointing FOR SURE. Since I only visited at night, I can't comment on how the experience would have compared during the day but now I guess I can say I've ""been there."" They take a digital photo of you for free, which you can retrieve from one of the kiosks at the top by emailing it to yourself, which involves some funny budget green screen action. There is a cafe but nothing fancy, just like cafeteria style. It was extremely windy and cold on the observation deck and no one was really out there besides some pretty determined selfie fanatics. One of the best parts was being able to see the Gehry building from an aerial perspective."
This historical site of the 1961 world fair is a must see in Seattle. The view is amazing inside or outside the observation deck. There is a small cafe at the top selling Starbucks coffee or small snack type food.
"Not as tall as I expected, but they've figured out their logistics to transport people up to the top pretty quickly.  Nice views atop."
"We ate at the restaurant at the space needle (See review for restaurant). Overall, this was a great part of my trip to Seattle. ,AWESOME view of the entire Seattle area. We were also lucky enough to be there on a clear, sunny day! So Beautiful!,I highly recommend eating at the restaurant. Just spend a little more than a ticket to the observation deck and you get a great meal! So worth it. Plus the restaurant rotates every 45 minutes and you get a wonderful, relaxed view of Seattle - without having to move! Woohoo."
"Observation deck. Free booze. 50-70mph winds. More free booze. Utterly cold. More free booze. Where am I?,Yes, this was a hosted event, the SC11 technical program social event (conveniently timed to conflict with of the ""women in HPC"" session back at the conference center).  If you can visit on someone else's dime, it's a fun place.  I didn't see anything really justifying the daily price, but my vision was slightly, um, impaired.,Oh, and it's very, very cold outside at night in November on the top."
"Space needle, the one place you should visit in Seattle simply because it's a tourist attraction. It offers a wonderful view of the city . I went to Space Needle as part of the City Pass but only managed to go once. Sadly it was raining that day (imagine that xD) so couldn't take many good photos. Other than the beautiful city views not much to it. Very simple tourist attraction of Seattle."
"It's a bit pricey. $19 for an adult. The lines can be long.... but It's what embodies Seattle. How can I hate on it....,One nice thing is that they give you a free digital picture taken with a professional camera. At least they don't nickel and dime you for that."
"Being the tourists that we are, my friend & I had to visit the Space Needle on our brief visit to Seattle. We decided to get the CityPass and its definitely one of the best purchases we made on our trip. The Pass gives you morning and evening admission to the Space Needle within a span of 24 hours. Day & night admission on its own would already cost $31.50 so the $74 CityPass is definitely worth the money if you have time to explore Seattle.,If you've only seen the view from the top of the Space Needle in the morning, you HAVE to come back at night because it's honestly so much more beautiful! I only had a crappy 10 megapixel camera on my phone so my photos do not do the view any justice whatsoever. I was also slacking on taking photos because I just wanted to breathe in the view and admire it in person. I figured I was only in Seattle for a few days and nothing can capture me in Seattle in that moment but my own memory :),Visit the Space Needle in the morning and evening! If you can only do one, visit it at night! Before you go on the elevator that takes you to the top, they have photographers that take your photo for free. You can use one of the kiosks at the top and customize your photo with different SpaceNeedle backdrops & email it to yourself. I thought this was pretty neat since my friend & I were able to get a group photo with both the morning & evening Space Needle backdrops for free :D,*They also have a bar (not full, mostly beer and wine) but they do have a pretty full menu if you find yourself hungry at the top :)"
"I went up here in the height of summer for a meal and to see the views, and wow.,The restaurant is fantastic, with some great gourmet fare on offer. In line with the experience, it's pricey, and even budgeting we didn't escape with a bill under $140 for 2, and we could have easily spent more.,But of course it's all about the views and experience. This is one of the must-do things to do in Seattle, and is worth every single penny."
"Ok, well when one thinks of Seattle, what do they think about? I mean, besides Kurt Cobain or Frazer? The Space Needle, of course...,It was exactly how I imagined it to be. A relic from the 1960s that was certainly an engineering marvel in it's day. Now, an iconic tourist spot that gives people an excuse to write a quick two to three paragraph review.,It was a dark and stormy December day in Seattle, shocker I now. So, views weren't optimal. Thank you, captain obvious...,My funniest observation was that inside the nearby children's museum there is a Lego replica of the Space Needle and I noticed that pieces of it had fallen off. Given, the actual Needles age, and apparent state, it felt very fitting and made me smile. Who says you can't find a ray of sunshine up here?"
"$19 to ride an elevator? I was hoping there would be something spectacular at the top but no. You get up there, look around and come back down.,It does not matter what I say about the space needle. It is a landmark and will continue to make money no matter what."
"How could I go to Seattle and not go up in the Space Needle? I recommend getting the City Pass if you are doing any of the other attractions. It allowed for two visits so you could see it in day light and in the dark.,The line to the top took quite a while, but the views were spectacular. You really get get a feel for the wind from the top, be sure to wear a jacket!,I didn't care to try the restaurant, and I am sure the cafe on the observation deck is overpriced. But seriously, do you really need a coffee and pastry ever 5 minutes? Then again, this is Seattle..."
"One of the attractions I have wanted to check off my travel list while Simon N & I were up in Seattle was to take a snapshot of the monumental Space Needle, which was pinned up in 1962 for the World's Fair.  What I totally didn't expect was to actually visit up above the Needle itself--& additionally take more pics from there--granted that we came to this swell city in mid-August.,Assuming that acrophobia was the cause is utter balonie; I just thought that $20 per person for being 520 feet in the air was a bit too high for me--pun intended.  We paid online--on Simon's smartphone--with a combo deal of the Space Needle & the nearby Chihuly Garden & Glass Museum for a total of $34 per person.  But from immersing into the former's insanely amazing & intricate artwork (which obviously will be reviewed separately), & then ascending 70-something stories high while our elevator man narrated its history of the latter, that combined experience along with the love of sky-high views was worth more than the price paid.,We stayed & savored the sky from dusk 'til the sun completely disappeared at almost 10 at night, admiring the 360-degree view of the city lights, Lake Union, Puget Sound, boats & ferries crossing the lakes, the Great Wheel from afar, & planes landing to the SeaTac Airport.  Lots of photographs & flashes surrounded the deck, with not-so-surprising observations of attempted & accomplished selfies.  But if acrophobia somehow might creep up into you--& assuming you're at least 21 reading this--the Needle has a beer & wine bar available.,Personally a revisit is required, noting that daytime during the typically sunny summertime would be as marvelous.  Unfortunately we encountered an overcast during August, so if these gray clouds were absent, over yonder you'll be able to see Mount Rainier.  For now, this professional photograph, ,, taken before we entered the elevator was close enough.,So, that Space Needle: there's definitely more to do with it than just gazing at the piercing skyscraper."
"Great 360 degree view of Seattle.  Ironically though, while you're up here, you lose out on one of their most famous landmarks...because you're standing on it.,Standing out on the observation deck, you get gorgeous panoramic views of Seattle and the Pugent Sound.  Being that it's slightly removed from the downtown area, the views are probably a bit more scenic and expansive since you aren't limited to tall skyscrapers or anything like that.  Taking in all of the sights, I really wished I had a digital SLR to be able to take better pictures of the view.  If you want to get a closer look at one particular area, they also have some fixed binoculars and telescopes stationed around the deck for people to use.  ,The one knock I would have is that it's fairly expensive for a ticket.  For a regular adult ticket, it goes for about $18 for a single trip to the top.  Given that, I would also try to take weather into consideration if possible as well.  You really don't want to spend all that money to get up there and then end up getting stuck with fog or having to wait for the weather to clear.,Despite the cost, there are a couple of was to manage the cost.  If you were debating on checking out the view during the day or at night, they offer tickets that lets you take trips up at both times in a 24-hour period for only about $5 more than a regular ticket.  Also, a tip my friend had let me know about is that if you eat at the restaurant at the Space Needle, you might be able to avoid paying for the ticket up the elevator.,You probably want to come in the morning or early afternoon if possible, as there was a huge line for the elevators on my way out at about 2:30 in the afternoon.  If nothing else, it's one of those places that you have to go to so that you can say you went there.  I mean, what kind of trip to Seattle would it be if you don't go to one of, if not the most, iconic spots in the city?"
"I love this library with all my heart. Love the architecture, love the art pieces, love how it's so crazy big, the vast collection of knowledge...,Thank you LA Central Library for finding me the best textbook I've ever found for my career. Thank you for being the greatest public service building that's for free for us to use (with no so much DMV attitude). Thank you for being so magnificent and serene.,6 stars minus 1/2 star for the ridiculous parking and the nasty bathroom facing 5th st, I think... but yes 5 stars!,I will miss you when I move to SF.... :("
I love libraries and the Central Library in Downtown Los Angeles is no exception... The large atrium is my favorite part -- I saw people sitting above it in the most perfect bird's-eye view location. I liked seeing the space devoted to adult learners and their tutors. Kudos.
"I'm not sure how anyone can write more than a few sentences to describe this place. It's common sense to just go here and experience it yourself. Price is reasonable and it's a must see, especially at sunset.,Reasonable gift shop downstairs."
"One of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World (at least in my book), the Los Angeles Central Library is probably one of the most under-rated places in the entire super-megalopolis of Los Angeles.  I mean, have you ever been there?  You've got to go!  You may have been to any number of its hundred branches, but if you ever go to the Central Library downtown, be prepared to get your mind blown.  A temple to the god of books, this place is humongous, and I'm pretty sure that it has just about every book every published in English, and it has an enormous CD and DVD collection, though give yourself plenty of time - say, at least an hour or two - to flip through the titles, which are more or less alphabetized, but even then, you'll probably end up touching every single one of them to see what they are.  It's downtown, but the underground parking's pretty reasonable if you remember to get validated.  ,There are frequent events held there - readings, lectures, even screenings - but you don't need any excuse to go there.  You can wander the many, many floors of books (I don't even know now many floors there are, and I've been there dozens of times) all DAY, if you want, it's so super-colossal.  It's also beautiful inside, if you ignore the tell-tale whiff of the homeless, who also know a good place to hang out when they see it.  ,Who knew Los Angelenos were so damn literate?  Who knew that Los Angeles had the vision to build this cathedral to literacy?  Who knew that we were so lucky?  I love LA."
"Georgia has the most ridiculously inconvenient, and antiquated process to register vehicles and change drivers licenses.  It seems it is their goal to try to piss off as many people as possible.  ,Keep in mind I am criticizing the system only.  The employees were quite nice overall."
"WOW.  WOW.  WOW.,I lived near this building years ago, and never ventured in prior to this weekend.  Can we say PHENOMENAL?,I entered, got myself a LA County Library Card, and my friends and I meandered around the place...it's gorgeous... I mean, I want to go back to school just to study here, and am likley going to come here on the weekends to read the newspaper and ponder the ways of the world. ,The childrens literature area is gorgeous... the high ceilings are awesome, and the entire feel of the places makes your IQ increase by 10-50 points.  ,Love this place...a must see, especially for those Angelinos like myself who never make it out to downtown.  Go Go Go."
"Everyone says The Space Needle is a ""Must See"",I don't recall the exact price but it was $50+ for Two tickets to the TOP! ,I'll keep this review very short, yeah nice 360 degrees view of the City but NOT worth the price of admission, I wish I'd gone here instead , which is right next door.,The Needle itself is Cool, it's just an Overpriced trip to the Top, IMO."
"Well, before I moved here, I did what most tourists do and took a trip up the Space Needle. As it's a major attraction, it is a little pricey. So if you have a large group or you're visiting more than one attraction in downtown, I suggest getting the CityPass so you get the biggest bang for your buck as each attraction is usually about $15-$24. With that said, Space Needle....I like you but going up one time is enough for me. I can say I've done it even though it wasn't on my Bucket List (which I don't have). You do get a good view of the city and the Sound and all the other main large attractions of the lower Puget Sound. You can grab a bite to eat up there as well. Surprisingly there is quite a bit of room to walk around up there.,Now that I have lived in the Puget Sound area for a while, I will say that I like the Sky View Observatory at the Columbia Center building just down the street. Sky View is actually much cheaper and it's much higher and a lot less tourist so you can really enjoy the view. Plus, unlike the Space Needle, it's enclosed and the wind isn't all up in your face. But that is also somewhat what appeals about the Needle. You're exposed to the air and almost able to touch the sky with open hands *Disclaimer: You cannot physically touch the sky from the even the highest point of the Space Needle and it's actually physically impossible to touch or grasp ""sky""*,With all that aside, it's a tourist attraction and even people that have lived here forever still go or are even first timers. It is still worth a stop or at least a photo opportunity, so check it out. Try to find cheap parking somewhere or take a train or Bolt Bus up to Seattle to see it so maybe you don't have to pay for parking everywhere."
"Love love love Seattle!,There's nothing more to say then...,if you're visiting Seattle... you must go to the top of the space needle to see the awesome view of the city!,I got a lot of cool photos from the top and bottom of the space needle.,-Miss Yelp 2012"
"I want to live here.,There are just certain types of people who would live in a library, and I am one of them.  So many beautiful rooms.  The glorious murals.  The bright rotunda.  All.. the... books...,But this review isn't about any of that.  It's about postcards. :D,I've never been in a library that has a gift store before, that was a new one.  But I wanted to see if I could commemorate my first visit, and was sooo happy I did.  Postcards of Los Angeles sites are really really hard to come by, and they had an entire rack of vintage prints... not just of architecture of the library, but some looks of the city as well, including one of the ""Angel's Flight Trolley"", from the 1920's.  ,They also had some REALLY cool postcard books... one was of prints of famous illustrations in children's books.  Another was prints of vintage advertisements of American National Parks.  I was really impressed."
"For those that enjoy history, I would highly recommend including this during your trip to Philly. Although it's free, you do have to get tickets from the visitor center. As they are timed tickets, I would suggest getting there early in the day. Our park ranger Matt was great! Very informative and funny. It was awesome to see where America was born."
"When in Seattle, you do what every other tourists do: visit Pike Place Market, stick gum on the gum wall, catch a Mariners game, hit up a Starbucks, and of course, visit the Space Needle. This is a must-stop for anyone visiting the Emerald City for the first time, no exceptions.,First off, parking. I couldn't find regular parking anywhere. I went with the valet service, which was reasonably priced. I noticed that there were parking garages somewhat nearby, yet it was raining heavily the day of the visit, and I didn't have an umbrella. You'll purchase your $19 ticket while on the ground at the gift shop/ticket station, and will get a humorous tour from the elevator operator while on the way to the top. ,Upon reaching the top at breakneck speed, you'll have the option of getting your picture taken, of which you can get a digital print (for a cost) to post to Facebook, etc. While at the top, there is a restaurant, yet its a bit pricey. While I passed on that aspect of the Space Needle, I did take advantage of the coffee and snack options. The outside deck? Its okay. The wiring around the observation deck kinda throws off the aesthetic value of the experience, but who cares? You are at the top of the Space Needle, man! How many of your friends can say that? ,I wound up taking pictures in the rain at the top of the Space Needle overlooking downtown Seattle. While I couldn't see all the way to Bainbridge Island (it was quite cloudy), I could see enough to get a good appreciation of Seattle. On a sunny day, I imagine that the city view is one of the absolute best in the country, save the ones from structures within cities named New York and Chicago.,For a structure built in 1962, the Space Needle is a timeless piece of architecture that still captures the imagination."
"My first couple of years in the Philadelphia area, when times were hard, I would take my TransPass from Upper Darby and end up at this building, sitting on the steps, thinking about how they struggled with differing ideas to begin a country, first by rebellion, and then, by constitution.,It had to be difficult, and the park rangers (no Jellystone Park or picnic baskets here) give you a great deal of information.  They do it well, and sometimes, someone will actually retain some of it.  Is anything more important than what happened here?  It justifies all the fighting for independence and all the struggles of a burgeoning nation.,When I was here in 2005 and 2006, you could hardly get close to the building, let alone sit on the steps.  I wanted to take some photos from across the street and had a park ranger pushing me.  It's good to see that a lot of the fortification is gone now and things are more pleasant.,There are museums all over Philadelphia and all over the country, but this should be everything to anyone who can claim to be a U.S. citizen because without it, there would not be any."
"Visiting the space needle as well as walking around the observation deck was BREATHTAKING!!!! The view of Seattle is stunning and absolutely gorgeous!,For a quick second, I felt as though I was Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Silly me!! ,We did the general admission priced at $21 per an adult. Before entering the elevator, please take advantage of taking free pictures, where you'll have the opportunity to then email yourself or share on Facebook in the gift shop at the end of the tour.,I ended up purchasing a frame and the staff printed a hard copy of my picture as well for me.,In the gift shop, they also have sample tasting of a variety of desserts. We decided to purchase a pound of chocolate chip and cream cake value at $7.00 or so.,They have a cafe and lots of seatings on the observation deck, where you can grab some hot beverage or have lunch while taking advantage of the sensational view Seattle has to offer.,This was a lovely experience and well worth it!!!"
I loved their view were u could see all Seattle. They have a restaurant at the top of the needle the whole thing moves around in a circle so if u happen to leave anything on the window sill when u look back u might find it in the other side of the room. I absolutely love the view. They also have a place were u can hang outside and look out at Seattle also a bar inside  I think everyone would enjoy this place
"I've been twice and never impressed with the food or service.,Overrated and over crowded; view isn't spectacular either. You can get a better view from Alki Beach. ,Definitely do dinner if you want to go up; I just think it's more worth it rather then paying the hefty fee just to go up the Needle.,While nice for a special occasion, everything is underwhelming and overpriced."
"Great experience with a amazing view over seattle! Nothing to add-/say. Simply good.,Entre Fee is around 20$, cards are accepted. Mono rail is departing near the Needle to downtown area. Recommend to visit the Science Center and Music museum as well."
"People have nowhere else to go to view the city and surrounding area (beautifully scenic, though not due to anything since the building was completed...), and they know it. The price is a bit steep, especially for how badly they jilted my family and I when we went. The elevator sent 3 loads of ""vip"" passengers down below where the people who only paid $20 for an elevator ride got on. Not even the tallest building in Seattle. The lack of service left me sleepless..."
"Amazing view!! def a must while in Seattle! However, if you're more of a foodie, then this may not be your best bet since the food is not the greatest! It is more for the service, environment and view! :)"
"Finally made it up here...for the very first time.,1) It's not as dated as I thought it would look.  ,2) The view is unparalleled here in the Northwest.   ,3) The food is supposedly better but there are a lot better places to eat.,I've been up in the Arch in St Louis and this is much more impressive.,AND, it's 20 snaps for the ride up if you don't eat there."
"Landmark....obviously a 'must visit'.....I visited recently during my trip to Seattle.,We were lucky & had a very clear & sunny day, blue skies, great photo-op when  you are at the top deck. Very cool."
"Food is ok.  For as much as it costs you are truly paying for the view and the experience.  Beautiful view and I love the rotation as you eat. Lots of travelers visiting so maybe even the chance to meet other people while there.,I would not go again.. But it is a must for experience :)"
"Space Needle - 'nuff said.,360 views of Seattle, if you go as the sun sets you have a different view every 5 minutes. Take the monorail nearby to downtown shops, and spend some time at the Space Center while you are at it!"
"holy hair blowing wind batman! ,it was quite fun to go here for the first time and get to have this one of a kind experience. I got some great shots and they even didn't mind me charging my cell phone in one of their plugs while I hung out and had a beer.,Price of the ticket is the only thing bringing it to 4 stars."
"This is a must see in Seattle. Not because it's over priced, but because it is a Seattle icon. OK so it's $18 which is a bit much for an elevator ride, but it comes with a free digital picture...wow. Anyway, you have to go on a clear day, which is few and far between. I happened to go on a clear day, and I did enjoy the views from the top. It was because of the great view that I found a food truck festival down the street!! Double score! ,You can also go to the top at night, which is something I want to see...eventually. Parking is expensive, but if you can walk a block or two there are plenty of pay lots where the rate is not nearly as expensive as the parking at the Seattle Center."
"This is worth a trip especially if you have the Seattle City Pass booklet.  We went on a cloudy morning on Valentine's Day,  but the view was still worth the cost.  I was impressed with all the interactive activities inside at the top of the needle.  It was a fun family time for us, and we loved the gift store at the bottom.  ,Next time, we want to see it at night!"
"Must see if in Seattle however if you have been or eaten at the stratosphere in vegas you might be a little disappointted in the space needle!,LOL!,But check it out!"
Nice to look at.   Went in a sunny day.  25 min wait to get up and 45 min wait to get back downstairs.  They have three elevators but only running.  Major fail.    For views it is one of the best.   Would return if they figure out better crowd control.   Tip don't buy foot up on the deck bring your own there are limited tables but can make it worth the visit.
"overpriced.  But beautiful on a clear night. Was able to see all of the harbor.    But I doubt there are many clear nights.   ,Woild I go again probally not."
"For clear views of the Seattle skyline, Elliott Bay, Lake Washington, Mt. Baker, and Mt. Rainier nothing beats the Space Needle.  It's a little pricey, but if the weather is nice and the skies are clear it is well worth it.  It's not as tall as the CN Tower in Toronto or the Sears Tower in Chicago, but it's certainly high enough to give you a breathtaking view.,Tips:,- Admission is $18.  For an extra $6 you can go twice in 24 hours, which affords you the opportunity to see the Seattle skyline lit up at night.,- If you go first thing in the morning or late in the evening you have a better chance of avoiding some of the lines.,- It can get really cold and windy when you're 60 stories up, so even if it's temperate at ground level you may want to bring a jacket or hat to ward off the cold on the observation level."
"The space needle was a very satisfying experience that I would recommend to anyone. The view is spectacular- you can see a long way in all directions. There is a café and a giant gift shop, which has a bunch of cool stuff.  There are binoculars and telescopes that are a little blurry but cool to look through.,The staff is friendly and and it is clean.,It is very busy.,This was an overall great experience. ,I would give this 4.5 stars if I could."
"I am knocking off one star for all the smelly homeless people coughing on me.  ,Otherwise, a stellar locale if you're a fan of architecture and interior design.  Make sure to take a ride in the glass elevator ... the elevator shafts' walls are lined with old card-catalogue cards!"
"I haven't gotten around to review this. And I feel so guilty about not having done it sooner.,But my review will be short, to the point and sweet.,I LOVE THE LIBRARY!!!,Go to this library, and try not to get lost!"
"Buy your tickets in advance online! They do have smartphone scanners but they aren't always working, so it is preferable to print the tickets. There's a Fedex about a 5 minute walk away where you can print your tickets.,On the Saturday of President's Day Weekend, we got there at 10am but they had actually opened at 9:30am, which was unadvertised online. There was a short line (5-10 minutes) to get our bags checked, take a photo, and get in the elevator.,It was rainy and cloudy that day, but we could still see the base of Mt. Rainier in the distance! And the skyline wasn't obstructed at all.,There's this other camera outside facing downtown. You stick your ticket into the slot, stand at the marked spot, and it takes a photo. At the consoles inside you can scan your ticket again and get the photos emailed to you.,Even though we had printed tickets on 8.5""x11"" paper, we were able to fold it up so it could fit into the ticket scanner."
"This place is HUGE- my plan is to take a wing at a time, meandering through, running my fingertips along the ancient book spines, while I hear the gentle murmur of other patrons. It brings to mind the fact that there are very few places large people congregate to just be quiet. Churches, museums, libraries. I think that says something. And this is definitely one of the places to go to take advantage of that concept. The architecture is open, allowing light to gently pour in. The comfy chairs are plentiful (beware the occasional hobo couch-surfer). Plus, validated parking on Saturdays is only $1 for the WHOLE DAY! That ALONE is enough to make me want to spend every Saturday there."
"Alright, I definitely read all of these reviews before going to the tag office, and was super freaked out. I prepared all weekend getting all kinds of random documents together just in case they asked. I also took a book, bought a new game for my iphone, and told my boss i might not be in until after lunch. I knew I was in for a horrible morning because I was there to get registration and a title for a car I bought from SC. ,But, things turned out waaaay better than I thought. I got there at 9:00 on a Monday, there was NO line, so I sat right down. The lady behind the glass was super friendly and helpful. I gave them my title, my insurance, my ID, my emissions papers, and she moved me down to the next guy within a minute. He entered my info in the computer, verified my current address, handed me a tag, said I'd get my new title in 10 days in the mail, and that I owed him $38. ,That was it! I got back to my car within 15 minutes of leaving it. I can't believed I put so much money in the parking meter, but who could know it would have been such a pleasant experience. ,My advice is, read the website VERY carefully. Know what documents you need to take with you and be prepared. Maybe I just hit a really lucky day. Who knows? I just wanted to let you know that it IS possible to have a good day at the tag office."
"This is no ordinary library.,You could actually bring a date here! ...check out the rotating art exhibits, sneak into story-time in the children's section, listen to guest speakers, and get ""lost"" between the stacks during a tour of the library. Aww yea. Get your nerd-swerve on.,Tips: As of April 2007, all branches of the LAPL are letting the public suckle their free Wi-Fi teets."
"Did you know it costs $19 to go up to the top of the Space Needle? Neither did I, until recently. My friend and I took a trip to the top and we spent some time taking photos of the 360 degree view of the city. Blue skies galore! It was a gorgeous June day. The ticket is good all day so you can go up and down as you please. You can also eat in the restaurant if you have a reservation. If you're already there, why not? ,Well we opted to go elsewhere for dinner but I'm sure the restaurant gets plenty of proposals, anniversary and birthday celebrations through its doors. The Space Needle is an iconic landmark and you should visit it if you ever get the chance. I had lived in Seattle years ago and never went to the Space Needle but I'm glad I was able to this time around."
"I used to live within a stone's throw of the Space Needle, but I didn't visit it until after I had moved from the area.,The Space Needle is pretty much what most people think of when they think of Seattle - that and probably Starbucks.  You pay almost $20 to go up to the top, walk around in a 360 degree angle to view Seattle, and then come back down.  The views from the top are rather nice but only if you can get a clear sunny day.  They even have binoculars free of charge at the top.,If you can somehow get a discount (BOGO or half off, or something!) I would recommend going up to the top.  But I would never pay $20 for one person to go back up there!"
"Is it me or are there really a lot of people who stares around here?  I'm just a curious little girl who wants to read some books on a summer weekend!  GAWDDDD.  ,Wow, I really like this library because of their massive, extensive collection of books!  I was in luck because everywhere I turned were shelves of books I planned to look up on the catalog.  As I was pacing across the lonely, scary aisle on the literature floor, I somehow stumbled upon ""High on Arrival.""  That's so weird because that was the first book I thought of upon entering the library.  Hmm, I think my mind was being read!,Ugh, I really wanna keep this short so here goes. ,There's panda express in this library so yay if you're a panda fan.  I didn't get anything from there of course, the service was kind of slow and the line felt long so I opted for a muffin instead at Food 630.  IDK why it's called Food 630, why didn't they just call it Food?  ,The main floor's restroom for women was smelly and dirty.  Why don't they have hand towels in their restrooms?  That's just kind of bothersome to me.  Maybe to weed out the people who comes in to shower?  ,Oh, I almost flipped out when I entered the parking lot because I saw signs of parking prices.  In no f$%^&*( way am I gonna pay to read books at a library!  No way!  But then I saw another sign for validation and that it'll be only $1 for parking.  Hm, I guess $1 is worth staying in a library for several hours.  Especially at this library!  It's SO BIG!,If you ever wanna get some real studying done (if you like to study at libraries), this is the place for you!  There are A LOT of quiet, not-so-quiet spots for you to choose from on 7-8 floors.  There are like hundreds of spots so no need to worry about sitting next to someone who's noisy, annoying, or takes up too much space!  I might come here during finals sometime.  Why wouldn't I?  They have a ""cafeteria.""  O.M.G!!!,There are also a lot of things I haven't covered like the floors and shizz like that but I'm pretty sure the previous reviews will enlighten you better with that.  ,What I really want to review about are the hobos and creeps who lurks around here.  I don't wanna be mean but Honesty is the BEST policy! =)  It's a library, not a cot!  I never knew the sofas in the quiet room is also the sleeping room!  I kid you not, everybody on those sofas were sleeping!  Well, I understand.  What better way to spend summer days than napping on a 7-year-old sofa in a library after reading 2.5 pages of a half-inch novel?  And tell me that a woman who looks like she's in a trance does not freak you out!  ,What really creeps me out are the weirdos who just stares and STARES.  WTF, I'm not a show!  This is not Vegas.  Stop watching me!  Don't snarl at me!  Don't growl at me!  Don't utter Hi.  Whatever happened to handshakes and a genuine smile as a normal social human introduction?  GAWDDDD.  Oh, it kinda smells in here too.  ,I like the children's area because it's so...innocent and free from...danger.  Anyways, I stay here until I start to feel like a pedophile.  ,I REALLY like this library,  but the patrons here may be my deterrence from coming here regularly.,Maybe this wasn't so short after all =)"
To stand in the very room on which our country was framed was amazing to say the least.. I can only hope that in 200 years this hall is still frequented and the same emotions felt. It is more than worth the admission price!
"The Space Needle is most definitely a must see when visiting Seattle but I think once is more than enough. I wouldn't say it's that jaw dropping once you see it but it's the biggest staple of Seattle so it's definitely a tourist trap. ,I've been to Seattle twice to visit and I asked my friend if we can skip actually going on my second trip there. The first time I visited I ended up getting a package deal online for the Space Needle + Chihuly Garden and Glass Exhibit. Once you're in the Space Needle, the 360 view is beautiful and an employee will take a photo for you. The photo is taken with a green screen back drop because you can edit the background to your liking at one of the stations. It's pretty convenient and the picture will be emailed to you immediately. ,The second time I visited, my friends and I wanted to grab a drink at the restaurant so we wouldn't have to pay the fee and get the perks of the view. Unfortunately, they were booked for the whole weekend (probably because it was Memorial Day). I plan on doing so if I ever visit Seattle again. ,Oooooh! And of course, there is a Starbucks once you're instead the Space Needle (they're everywherrrrreee)."
"A must see for anyone visiting Philadelphia, and especially for Philadelphians too.,How many other countries can you stand in a room where that country started?,Get free timed tickets across the street at the visitors center (6th/Market) and enjoy the air conditioning there.,It's good to visit on less busy days such as Mother's day, Christmas Eve, etc. (which also conveniently happens to be when out of town family may be visiting).,And if you live here and have never been, what are you doing with your life?"
"If you are in seattle you have to do this at least once. I think it was $21 per person and you'll have to wait in line for at least 30 mins, but once you are up there the views are unbelievable. ,If possible try and go up on a crystal clear day so you can see all of the mountain ranges. ,It wasn't too crowded, there is a starbucks at the top (of course). It can get a little chilly so bring a jacket just in case."
"Oooh, pointy.  A nice show, and the 5-year-old had a blast.  It also opened her eyes (literally) to some of the amenities nearby, which then became must-do items as well.,And the painted store logos on the roofs of neighbors, as to allow easy-to-find McDonald's and such, clever marketing, neighbors."
"One of the famous landmarks in PNW! And of course, the icon of the city of Seattle.,Parking here is ridiculous and we ended up not going to the needle.,I would suggest checking out the SkyView Observatory to get a better view from above.,You even get to the Space Needle itself. Plus, it's more affordable than what you're paying in the needle. ,Great place to check out when you're in the city!"
Don't let the price keep you from experiencing this awesome landmark. Yes 22 bucks seems a bit pricey in my opinion but given the fact that the views are amazing I feel like it's totally worth it. I went in the evening just as the sun was setting so it was beautiful! I love that your price includes a free digital print and they also have a selfie camera attached to the building which I found to be a cool little feature! Would definitely recommend if you are visiting Seattle for the first time!
"I had such an amazing time here! It was so fun going 605 feet up in the air! I felt like I was on top of the world. It costs $20 to go up to the top. I was lucky because I came on a clear, non-rainy day. You have a 360 degree view of the city. There's even a restaurant in the middle & a bar on the top. ,The bartender at the bar was really nice & was happy to give me lots of samples of the different wines they had. My uncle & boyfriend each had the local beer which tasted really good. ,This is definitely a romantic spot to take your significant other. Just watch for the rain & clouds."
Really enjoyed the Space Needle - lots of interesting facts about its construction and fabulous views of Seattle.  You can even get a snack and enjoy it while you take in the scenery.
"At a small mini bar counter in the observation deck area, one server refused to serve me alcohol based on the assumption that I looked too young. I tried to assure him I was 21, as I was trying to ask him about the wine on the menu, but he wouldn't take my ID or provide me with even basic customer service. He kept his back turned and attention on other tasks (there were no other customers around). He also claimed that because my (minor) boyfriend was with me I wasn't allowed to purchase a single drink for myself. ,*I'd like to make clear that I received wonderful customer service at the actual (SkyCity) restaurant, and had absolutely no problem ordering a drink. This only occurred at the observation deck."
"Sure, it's touristy - that's why it was built, after all - but after all these years it's still cool.  The views are magnificent and the surrounding museums and exhibits all make for a good way to spend a day in Seattle.  It's about an hour's walk from downtown, and Olympic Sculpture Park is along the way.  A little pricey, perhaps, but worth it for young and senior-discounted old!"
"Being a first time Seattle tourist, I was blown away!  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!  Really shows what Seattle has to offer!  Glad we waited an extra day to go to the Needle, clouds cleared up from the day before to make the view glorious!,It really does remind you of The Stratosphere in Las Vegas, but the views here are so much different.  The air is crisp and clean, and the expanse of Seatlle is spectacular.  If you are a tourist, and have to do tourist-y things in Seattle, the Space Needle is probably a pretty good bet.,It costs around $22 bucks per person to go to the top, but once there you can stay as long as you want until the doors close.  We were there in the early afternoon, if we had the time we probably would have stayed to watch the sunset and get some night views.  There are a few snack stations in the top of the Needle, of course serving overpriced wine, drinks, and finger foods.  My advice if you're staying, bring your own eats!  They do check your bags on the way up the elevator to the top of the Needle, but the security guys aren't too picky as long as you aren't bringing an entire meal up with you.  ,With your admission to the Needle, you do get a FREE digital photograph which you can get a copy of when you claim them at one of the kiosks located at the top.  You can pick your own background and everything.  Send this free digital pic to your email and you can show all your friends.  Or for the cheap ($5 special that day) you can get a physical pic of yours that will come in a Space Needle frame (cheapie cardboard kind) that you can put on your desk or dresser.,What made it even easier for us to get to the Space Needle was that the tram to get there?  It was literally connected to our hotel, the Mayflower Park.  We walked up a flight of stairs, two turns later we were in front of the tram going from Westlake Center to the Space Needle.  Only cost around $5 per person roundtrip.  Super cheap, super easy, super convenient.  ,Loved the views, loved the air, and loved the activities all around the Space Needle.  Downtown Seattle, I hope to one day be back!  Unlike the Supersonics."
"My first time in Seattle, and honestly the needle wasn't as amazing as everyone says. If your gonna go, go in the morning, not at night. In the morning it's a little more expensive, but you can see everything.,I went at night cause it was cheap, it was stormy so they closed the observation deck, so my party wasn't even able to go outside. All the bars an cafe up in the deck were closed too. Overall, really cool history, and I would go again in the morning. But NOT at night.. ,It's a waste if its at night."
"Okay, you took the time travel to Seattle, so see Seattle! Sure, people are going to say you can save money and go here or there to get better views, but you'll be IN the freaking Space Needle! If you want to ""save"" money, I'd suggest dining in the restaurant that spins (maybe lunch) because you also get to go up and take in the views. This way you bought food and a view. I, however, bought the City Pass and got to go one time during the day and the next time the following night. Seemed worth it since we also went to the other sites included."
"If you live or visit Seattle, you need to go up and check out Space Needle at least once. It's a once in a lifetime experience. It's truly remarkable and great way to view Seattle.  ,I came here this summer with my family on vacation.  We took the monorail from the Westlake Center mall which was very cheap and convenient way to get to Seattle Center.  Day ride up to Space Needle cost $19 per person (night $26).  The ride up was smooth and as soon as you get to the top you're presented with a spectacular view of Seattle's skyline and waterfront.,What I really like about this place is you get to walk around outside and enjoy the view below from the observation deck. No glass window to block the view of your camera. It really gives you a great picture quality shot of Seattle.  It made it easier for me to get lots of panoramic picture shots of Seattle.  In addition, they have a seating lounge inside with a bar. Get yourself a cocktail and enjoy the view.,I will definitely be back, especially for the night ride."
"Of course I snatched at my first chance to go here while I was in Seattle. The beau and I took the monorail from downtown for a whopping $2.50/pp! ,It is pretty expensive, but that's why it's a tourist trap. They only allow a certain number of people in the elevator at a time, so the wait could be long. While in the elevator going up to the observatory, make sure you steal a spot by the window so you can see the view.,Depending on the weather, it does get cold up there so make sure you dress warm.,The view is breathtaking, no wonder it's so famous."
"Was there 2 years ago, two expensive and the worst coffee place (starbucks?) I have ever been to! I got food poisoning from a lox salmon bagel which was probably not properly refrigerated and not fresh. Was there for a wedding and threw up for two days at our hosts house ...super emberassing! Never has a poisoning this bad. Friends ate at the restaurant a few. months later and one of them got food poisoning as well...not worth it for the 10 second ride and 10 minutes up there. Too crowded in overpriced coffee place and food poisoning ruined my whole trip."
"What a touristy (overpriced) thing to do.,Taking the tram/trolley from downtown was mildly interesting and entertaining, and expensive.  Waiting in line to go up, and then looking out at Seattle at 490 feet and paying $30 was completely underwhelming.  If you've seen one city from a tall building, or airplane, you get the idea of what this is.,However, the grounds surrounding the space needle were a plus, because of the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibits that you can see (without having to pay to get admission).  This was what made the time spent there of value."
"I'm so happy I have a best friend who hasn't yet done any touristy type things since she moved up to this city 6 months ago. ,Expensive? Yeah, a little. But wow, so worth it! When it was built-it was one of the tallest buildings west of the Mississippi! Since then, it's like the 7th largest in Seattle. It's so majestic and space agey! ,We went on a Friday and did not have to wait very long to get to the elevators. The operators were very friendly and explained a little history about the Needle on the 10 mph ride up to the top.,It was very windy the day we went and started rainy but what a beautiful view! It was really too bad we couldn't stay out on the observation deck for too long. ,The gift shop can be a little pricey, but I ended up walking out with a little bit of the Space Needle fudge (hello, yum!?!?!?!? some of the best fudge I've ever had) and a few souvenirs.,Definite must see for anyone who is new to the city!"
"I felt like the Space Needle is expensive. We arrived at the Space Needle around 11am. Tickets are bought at the ticket booth. There will most likely be no line as it is a very fast procedure. We entered from the left side of the ticket booth and had our bags checked. From there, we waited in line, our photo was taken (it came with the ticket), and waited in line for the elevator. Because we went at 11am, the line was very long. My boyfriend and I waited for 30-40 minutes just to arrive in the elevator. From the elevator to the top of Space Needle, it took 81 seconds to get there. Upstairs, there was a bar, touristy activities, and of course, the scenery of the famous Space Needle. It was SUPER SUPER windy on the side where the water was so I felt a little nervous because I was already afraid of heights."
"Central LIbrary Theme Song,(sung to the tune of the Gilligan's Island Theme),Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,,A tale of a hidden gem,That started from some downtown steps ,With me and my good friend.,We started in the gift shop ,With eclectic wares galore,Then headed to the lobby,For a free hour tour, a free hour tour.,We marveled at the ceilings,Breathtaking paintings on the walls,The children's wing and puppet theater,With furniture so small, with furniture so small,The library's collection is amazing and immense,With DVDs,and CDs too,A language lab and some maps,Free wireless,The magazines and Teenscape room,In the library aisles.,The elevator is wallpapered ,With card catalog remains,It's worth taking a ride in cause,The effect is quite strange.,Walk through the Getty Gallery,The gardens outside too,A trip to the Central Library,Is a journey you must do."
i'm surprised they have a lot of books here!
"The Space Needle is Seattle's well talked about monument and greatest landmarks! You honestly can't come to Seattle without coming here!,The Space Needle was originally called ""The Space Cage"" which rises 605 feet/184 meters above Seattle, and was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River.,The whole concept of the Space Needle is to: Zip to the top of the Space Needles on the elevators which is 43 seconds and experience excellent views of downtown, Lake Union, Mount Rainier, and the Olympic Range mountains way across Puget Sound. Once you're located at the top, take in the views then check out the informational displays, which identify many different sites and events in the Seattle area outside you can even zoom in on them through high-powered telescopes. ,Pricing seems to change depending on the time of the year. I strongly encourage you to by a CityPass if you can because it's well worth it!,The views from the top are truly breathtaking. It's nice to go when the skies are clear but either way you will still have a fantastic time. ,The Space Needle is located next to Chihuly Garden and Glass, featuring Seattle artist Dale Chihuly's most significant work. If you can you should definitely go there as well!  The attraction features a large building and garden, glass house, bookstore and the Collection Café.,*Quick Tip-Your admission includes access to the observation deck and a free digital download from the Space Shots Photography Department."
"I have great memories of hanging out with my dad for hours in this place. It's def. one of several favorite childhood memories. I think, deep down, my dad would have liked to have been buried here. Why? My father worked for the L.A. County Public Library until his death. 'Nuff said."
"Super easy!! Needed to transfer my tag from my old car to my new car. Parked on the street at a meter, breezed through security, signs pointed me upstairs to the new location for Vehicle Registratoin. I walked in and was out 7 minutes later.  ,$5, no muss, no fuss!  Easiest interaction I've ever had with Fulton County!!!"
"The LAPL central library is listed as one of the five California librarys that serve as a PTDL, and they do have a patent desk, but alas, their automated patent system database (also known as WEST) is not functional.,How am I going to do my research, so I can be billionaire bully??"
"This place was not what I expected. The pictures were deceiving. It was not as big or awesome as they sell it to be. It was also very expensive for what it is. ,$22.05 per person ,When you go in there, you go in a little elevator and go up. Is a little loop up there, you can buy wine or water (for $3) ,The bad: ,Not cheap,Nothing much to do up there. ,The good:,They take a free picture of you and send it to your email. That was pretty cool. ,The view. It is pretty nice to take a look from so high up.,If you are already in Seattle, sure go see it, there is not much more to see anyway. If you are planning a vacation around Seattle having landmarks such as the space needle, better go somewhere else."
"If you haven't been to the top of a high building to see the view, it might be worth it. It doesn't have a ledge you can walk out on that is clear and you can see the drop below. The restaurant at the top is not always open, so you aren't there for a very long time. We only spent 15-20 minutes there. For us, it was overpriced for what you get. If you love Seattle or have never been to a high observation deck, it might be worth it. For the same price, I recommend the Chihuly Museum next door."
"Took the Red line over to Pershing Square....and headed north to the library.,WOW!!!,It was sooooo BIG. Every corner I would turn was just more and more to see.,I took alot of pictures....and looked at the Dodgers art work they had displayed on the walls in a couple of lil rooms.,Really nice place to go and look around....or read...do research..etc.,The street level bathrooms were horrible looking and very dirty and OLD...that's the only thing I can say bad about my visit"
"We walked down Market from our Convention Center hotel to the Visitor's Center just before 9 am. Easy walk. After picking up our timed entry tickets, we walked over to the Liberty Bell. Happily there were fewer than a dozen people at the Bell, so it was a pleasure to linger a few minutes and watch all the excited photography in progress.,The short walk over to Independence Hall is preceded by yet another security check (after Liberty Bell)......then on to the tour. Look, this was really the highlight of our short visit to Phiily. Our tour leader, Ranger Gus, seemed to be an unassuming straightforward Ranger one would encounter at any park. Once he got started with his presentation, it was magic in American History. Gus has a real talent for bringing the Founder's personalities to life and he integrates that with all the important historical events we all thought we knew so well. ,Go ahead, ask him a question about the Declaration or Constitution or any of the Hall's displays, and you will be delighted by his enthusiasm and depth of knowledge. Bring your kids, they already know more about this stuff than you have forgotten."
"Bought tickets ahead of time online and got a discount on combo tickets that included the Chihuly museum. Downside was we had to pick a launch time in advance and get there on time to redeem the tickets. Can also buy tickets onsite with the same deal which is what I would recommend unless going in high season when ticket lines are long.,We were debating whether to eat at the SkyCity restaurant instead so as to get to the observation deck for free but the restaurant is closed between lunch and dinner.,We did buy really yummy Kobe beef hot dogs and cold Pilsner beer from the cafe on the observation deck. Sat at the tables for over an hour and enjoyed the view. Even though it was drizzling and cloudy we were able to see everything clearly."
"Very cool.  Our tour guide was amazing.  Kudos to the NPS staff there, they really made it come alive!"
"Great tour! We reserved tickets online the night before for $1.50 a piece. After picking them up at will call, we headed over to the hall to get through security in time. We ended up there almost 30 minutes before our tour time. We eventually stood in the stand by line and ended up getting a ticket upgrade so we could enter 15 minutes earlier. Our tour guide was wonderful and it was a really nice experience. It seems like even if you don't have tickets, you'd have a good chance of getting in by waiting in the stand by line."
Amazing view on a clear day. Love seeing the city from up top and the sea planes fly by landing into the near by lake. There's a restaurant up top that allows for a beer or glass of wine while you soak up the view. A must visit for anyone in Seattle.
"The Space Needle is one of those places that you see once and that's plenty. With the steep price of admission for a 360 view of Seattle, I went with the option of eating at the restaurant before going up to the top for free. Shoot, might as well get some food out of it if I'm gonna have to pay to go up there right?,The elevator ride up is pretty cool since the doors are clear and you can see the view as you go up. The observation deck is just like any other high-rise building... extremely cold and windy up top. Seattle isn't exactly known for it's great weather either, so I'd try to pick a day to go when it's not overcast or raining (good luck with that). As for the view itself, it's cool. I still prefer the view from the Empire State Building, but like I said, it's one of those things you gotta go see as a tourist. ,The restaurant itself was an interesting experience. You're seated on a rotating platform and you can see the whole 360 degree view of Seattle during the course of your meal. I went for lunch and the food was unimpressive, however, it is cheaper than dinner. So I guess it's okay to eat a blah lunch because at least you get to go up to the top for free."
"The Space Needle is the most iconic landmark in Seattle. It is the legacy of the 1962 World Fair. From a distance, it looks amazing. Ironically, it becomes less impressive as you draw closer since the rust and age of the structure become apparent. The observation deck is $21 which is a rip off. I knew it before I went up. However, I traveled a long way to Seattle so I decided to pay just to experience it. I took a quick stroll around the observation deck for 5 minutes and took the elevator back down. The views at the top of the Space Needle are very good. For example, you can see downtown, the sports stadiums (e.g. Safeco Field, CenturyLink Field, etc.), and Puget Sound. However, there are better views of the city (ones that include the Space Needle) that are free within the city. As a result, enjoying the Space Needle from afar in the city is sufficient. On the other hand, it is in an interesting area that is worth walking around. Nearby the Space Needle are Key Arena (former home of the former Seattle Supersonics), an IMAX theater in a science center, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, etc. The area is a 20-25 minute walk northwest of Pike Place if you pay for all day parking downtown and do not want to move your car.,If you are visiting Seattle and looking for recommendations, please see "
I thought that the space needle was a bit high in admission price at $21.00. I think it's worth $10.00-15.00 but then again it is Seattle's main tourist attraction. As for the view it was decent on a cloudy and overcast morning in Januray. I probably wouldn't come back but who goes to a tourist attraction twice if visiting the same city.
This is a cool place to take in Seattle from the top.. The views are spectacular and you can get great pics! We went to the restaurant for brunch wasn't impressed but the view is amazing.
"Breath taking view!!  It can get really crowded because of the limited space of the building, but it is really really nice.  We had an employee appreciation event here and everyone loved it.  This is definitely the location to host an event at if you want to be the talk of the town."
"During a recent trip to Seattle, the Space Needle topped my list of ""must see"" attractions. Finding the Space Needle was relatively easy, as it is one of the tallest building in Seattle. The area around the Space Needle was crowded on a Saturday afternoon, packed with tourists, people attending a local fair, and police for crowd management. ,The ticket booth is located at the bottom of the Space Needle, and the lines are long- it took about 20 minutes to get up to the ticket tellers. Tickets for the Space Needle ended up being more expensive than I thought. A regular ticket is about $25 at the ticket booth. If you buy your ticket ahead of time online, you can get your tickets for as cheap at $10. When you buy your ticket you are given a specific time for your space needle experience. ,Since I was a bit unprepared, I had to buy my ticket at the ticket booth.The only times available at the booth were in an hour. The group I was with did not want to wait, so we upgraded our tickets for $9 and got the VIP pass. The VIP included immediate Space Needle access, and the ability to skip all the lines leading up to the Needle. Additionally you get a lanyard and a 360 degree map. ,The Space Needle was pretty crowded, but I was still able to get some great views. The inside of the Space Needle is newly renovated and outfitted with multiple interactive attractions. My favorites were the map/guest book where you can add your name and the guest count. ,Of course, there is a HUGE gift shop with everything from clothing to toys to Christmas ornaments. Pricing here was not as unreasonable as the attraction tickets.  Parking around the Space Needle is not too hard to find, as there are a variety of parking lots. For 2 hours I paid $14. ,This is one attraction that should be on everyone bucket list."
"I'm torn on the Space Needle.  Its cool because you get the most amazing view of Seattle.  Besides coffee and Pike Place Market, the Needle is sooo...Seattle.  However, at $22 a ticket to take the ride up, I feel a bit ripped off. Its like of like when you go to Disneyland and you see families that have saved up for years to get there, only to find once inside the park they are charged $6 for a small churro, and $4.50 for a small soda. Yes, you've been to Disneyland...but, at what price?  On one hand it's ""priceless"" but on the other hand when you feel you're being taken advantage of because it is ""priceless"", that's what doesn't sit so well with me. ,Anyway, to get to the Needle, you can walk from downtown Seattle and I think its about a mile.  Or you can take the Monorail from Westlake station right up to the Needle's base. I haven't tried any of the cafe's or food at the Needle itself, but the Needle is right in Belltown, one of my most favorite neighborhoods in Seattle.  Just walk out a block beyond the Needle onto 4th street and you'll see some better (cheaper I'm sure) places to eat. There's a good pizza place, a Thai restaurant, I think a bar...many more selections than the Needle offers.,Anyway, I suppose the fact that you can say you've been to the top of the Space Needle is one of those badges that you can carry around for a lifetime.  And the view IS cool. If you get lucky on day without clouds, you can see Mount Rainer and that truly is priceless.  The one thing I would recommend is not to schedule a time when you buy a ticket to go up the elevator.  We picked a time, but there was no semblance of order of who was going when.  Just get your ticket, and get in line.  If you schedule time out, you just get into the line anyway and have to wait with everyone else so its not like you get to the front of the line of your time passed.,If you are in Seattle and find the weather is fairly clear, RUN to the Needle to get that view."
"I  was excited to visit Seattle, and see the famous space needle. This landmark is more hyped up than what it's actually is. First off the ladies taken reservation for the restaurant have a little bit of an attitude, everyone else I encountered was nice. i decided to go up to the observation deck, which ran me about 26 bux (its cheaper to buy your ticket online) I literally went up there for about 25mins, and came back down. So disappointment, view of the needle from the ground is probably the best view you will get!"
"The Space Needle is pretty cool to see for out of towners... probably cool to take your visiting friends to, as well.,Great views on beautiful days.,Is it worth $19?  Not so sure, but we paid it... got some cute take aways too!"
"So freaking beautiful and worth the money! I'm a touristy person and I refused to leave Seattle without visiting the Space Needle. The view is breathtaking and refreshing. I went right before the sunset and I seriously fell in love. Enjoyed that it was a 360 view so you can see all the different angles of Seattle. I would so come back if I was with someone who's never been before. Since it started to get cold, there weren't that many people but there was still a good amount. Definitely not overcrowded though. I would recommend wearing gloves if you're there during the Fall or Winter. There's also a Starbuck's inside if you want a quick pick-me-up! ,For someone who cares about experience, the $17 was definitely worth it to me. I considered eating at the restaurant but I decided to go to Paseo's instead. :D Parking wasn't bad either, we paid $12 for 2 hours across the street. Like any other downtown, the closer you are to a landmark, the most expensive parking is. If you don't want to fork out the money to go during the day and night, I'd recommend just going right before the sunset to get the best of both worlds."
"It's a good bucket list to visit especially when it' your first time experiencing a sky scraper. One of the issues I had here was the parking. Seattle is a difficult place to find parking especially when you're trying to avoid paying for parking which ranges about 1.50 per hour or more. You won't be needing to spend much time at space needle. I think about an hour will be the limit. Anyhow, on top of the needle is definitely a magnificent view of the city. Great way to take so many pictures and enjoy a bit of interacting of the touch screen where you can enter your name and location of where you're from. On top of that, you can add pictures through the screen so everyone can view it. Which was very interesting. I bought the tickets for $36 which includes the glass museum. My recommendation for parking, is find the meter parking and pay for a low price if you're looking to not spend too much on it. It is behind the duck shuttles which have plenty of parking."
"Although you get a great view of the city. The entire city. Its really not something you go to more than once. Obviously, its busier on clear days. Since Seattle doesn't have many of those, views from this high up can leave something to be desired. ,The observation area is actually pretty small. There is an outdoor area that you can walk all the way around. But the area is limted and can seem even smaller when everyone is taking pictures of everything. ,The inside is bigger but again nothing too great. I like that you get a free photo. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. To me, its not worth the price."
"This is the Mecca of all LA libraries.,You might get lost here.,It's about 5 levels of all-you-can read buffet complete with a little food court, and library store that sells stickers that read ""reading is sexy."",Do not overlook the music/dvd section in the Popular Library on the main floor. If you have the patience to comb through, there are some pretty good finds both new and classics!"
"Los Angeles cannot be proud of much, certainly not of public services. Most local government agencies are mind-munbingly bad, and that's their best quality. That cannot be said about the Los Angeles Public Library system, which boasts a network of dozens of libraries throughout the city and one of the most comprehensive collections of any library -- public, private or educational -- in the country.,The Central Library is the heart of it all in the heart of the city. It hosts the most books, videos, DVDs, periodicals and archival materials. The architecture, since it was reopened in 1994 after an arsonist devastated it several years before, is still stunning and modern and has aged well.,The library appears small from the outside, as the visible building is four stories above ground. Most of the collections are in the lower levels, and windows show how the library recedes underground, exposing the slope of Grand Avenue.,The library is large, but several maps are available, as is the assistance of library employees. The Central Library is also a mini-theme park for books, of sorts. The Maguire Gardens have a signature waterfall display and curvilinear foot paths, and the main floor has a food court and gift shop. The Central Library is also the place to be for celebrity book readings. The late Gregory Peck was one frequent host, but other prominent literary, educational and entertainment figures step in as well.,The area around the library has the highest parking rates in downtown L.A., as just an hour is more expensive than a $3 day pass, which goes a lot farther. It's an even better value since most of the downtown L.A. bus routes run near the library, as do the Metro Red and Blue lines two blocks south.,Transit access: Metro Red and Blue lines, Metro Rapid lines 714, 720, 740 and 745, all local lines with numbers 1-99 and their limited-stop counterparts, and all express lines numbered 400-499; all LADOT DASH lines downtown except D and all Commuter Express lines numbered 400-499 and 534; Antelope Valley Transit Authority Line 785; all Foothill Transit 400-series busway express lines, though only 480 runs outside of rush hours; Montebello Municipal Bus Lines 40, 50 and 341/342/343, Orange County Transportation Authority lines 701 and 721; Santa Clarita Transit Line 799; Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Line 10; and Torrance Transit lines 1 and 2."
"Its definitely something to check out atleast once while in Seattle. We went early in the morning on a Wednesday and had absolutely no wait. ,Dont go on an overcast day. I know that can be hard for Seattle but it's really not worth it because of how much less the visibility is. I suggest going at night or for sunset.,Its a bit overpriced as well for the experience. I think the free picture setup they have on the deck is a nice feature."
"i love libraries and frequent my local branches often. that love probably has a lot to do with my weekly attempt to wear something to work that could pass for a naughty librarian.  ,While living in NYC, i took a pilgrimage weekly on sundays to the Grand Army Plaza Library near me in Brooklyn, the burough's Central Library. ,LA Central Library is a dream, and Sundays at the library have been reinstated.,grand but not pretentious, easily laid out, i plan to come back for history and soc depts next week, managed art, history and science this time around, and i didn't even intend to go into the dvd/cd section...i started at audio books, turned around and found myself in classic dvd's OMG! left with dr. caligari and day the earth stood still and a number of pretty heavy books including a midcentury text on basics of millinery, very psyched about that one...i took one look at the huge foreign section and was completely overwhelmed...next week for certain.,Sunday parking $1 all day on Flower, Can't beat it!,LA has actually given back to angelenos with the upgrades, renos, rebuilds and expansion of public computers in every local branch.  it is really a beautiful thing!"
"If I could rate it lower, I probably would. How frustrating to move somewhere new and hit brick wall after brick wall with something so basic as registering a vehicle! ,I too have 2 names on my Michigan car title, mine and my father's, which makes registering the car in GA *impossible*, according to the woman I spoke to on the phone at the DMV. She said my father, who lives in Michigan, would also need a GA driver's license if I ever wanted to register the car here. Is this really true? I asked her what my options are and she said I didn't have any.,So here I am...nearing day 30 of trying to get this resolved. If I go past 30 days, do I get thrown in jail? Who knows! All part of the fun of moving to Georgia, I guess!,As I see it, my options are:,1. Refinance the car so the title is in my name alone, which will cost me considerable cash. That's why there was a cosigner on the loan in the first place...silly me.,2. Have my pops sign a notarized power of attorney (for which state?) to the lien holder on the vehicle to have his name removed from the title, then have that faxed to the GA DMV. Not clear on how this would work.,3. Who knows? I'm not a lawyer and ""I have no options"".,4. Become addicted to drugs and stop caring.,Advice to others: just buy a new car in Georgia...or just move somewhere else! Lots of other states (Michigan included) would be happy to have a new resident."
"Really beatiful library with large selection.,My only and biggest complaint is parking which SUCKS!!!!,Street parking is ridiculously expensive and you're likely to get a ticket ($55 - ridiculous but I could write a novel about the absurdity of ticket costs in LA), if you're anything like me and you like to spend a few hours browsing through books and hanging out.,The garage is $4 per hour with library validation and you better get it validated (at the information desk on 1st floor of library) or you could end up paying over $30!!!! It's also very confusing to figure out where you're allowed to park in the garage (bad signage) and the car wash and valet people just yell at you not to park in certain areas, they don't specify where you ARE allowed to park. Also, the signs say to pay for your parking at lever P-1 but unless you ask someone it's hard to find the ONE payment machine located near the elevator that is under construction.,I would recommend walking or taking public transportation to this library or don't go at all. You'll be so stressed out from the whole parking situation you wont enjoy your visit. My first time going to this library was extremely unpleasant because I didn't realize how many hoops I would have to jump through. I'll be requesting items online and picking them up at Edendale branch from now on. Too bad becasue it is a really nice library but what a pain. ,Another Con is all the homeless people hanging around the nooks and crannys outside. But it is LA and homelessness is rampant."
Okay it's cool. The three star rating is just because there are so many other amazing things to do in Seattle if you only have three days. Like would you really go see the Eiffel Tower in Paris with three days? You would if you follow a tour guide book. Don't follow the tour guide book. Go see the Fremont troll.
"Meh. I guess you have to go up the space needle at least once while visiting Seattle, but I can't say I'd do it again. Our tickets were part of the Seattle Citypass. It was a cold & rainy Friday night when we went up, but the view was still very nice. Wish I could have gone up on a clear night/day, I bet the views are spectacular!"
"I love LA. Im happiest when I can just jump on the train, and spend the day here. The library is definitely in a prime location."
Really cool to see where our founding fathers created America! If you're planning to visit be sure to reserve free tickets online and pick them up at the visitors center. This way you don't have to hope there's tickets available or be put on the wait list.
"It's worth it for the view!,I was in Seattle.. I HAD to do it.  How could I not?  ,The ""elevator guides"" were friendly and knowledgeable.  The staff was nice.  I didn't try anything from their food court, and I only did a quick walkthrough of their overpriced souvenir shop.,But really, the Space Needle experience is just all about THE VIEW... which is spectacular.  I went first thing in the morning, which was nice.  There wasn't much of a crowd and I got to walk around it 2 or more times before it started to get pretty busy."
"There were two things that I had to see on my first ever visit to Philadelphia, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  Since they were right next door to each other, the logistics of getting to see both of them was simply too easy.  Tours of Independence Hall are given frequently (one starting ever 20 minutes?) during the day, but require tickets for a timed tour that can be obtained at the Independence Visitor Center free of charge.,We arrived 20 minutes before our tour start time to give us plenty of time to clear the security checkpoint prior to entering Independence Square and the waiting area for the tour.  National Park Service rangers give the tours.  Our tour guide, Ranger Knight, was exceptional in his ability to engage the group, pass along a wealth of information about this historically significant site, and keep it fun and interesting.  It was apparent that despite probably having given the tour hundreds if not thousands of times, he was passionate about what he was doing and was proud to represent his hometown, Philadelphia.,Frankly, Independence Hall is an old building that isn't all that impressive architecturally and aesthetically.  However, to dismiss Independence Hall and not visit it would be a huge mistake since, much like the Liberty Bell, it's not what it is, but what it means to our nation and its history that's important.  Independence Hall is a must see."
"Ahead of time - I have an awful fear of heights. The last time I was up high on buildings were the Empire State Building and the Stratosphere. Both times did not go well. The fact I can fly with no problem is a blessing I do not try to question.,My stepmom took us here to have the brunch. The top of the building and the structure is very sound, so you don't feel rocking when the wind picks up at any point. At first, I felt a little queasy, but I quickly was able to conquer it. The brunch was really good - the service prompt, especially from Kandra, and I highly recommend the whiskey cured bacon appetizer. When you pay the $50, the food quality isn't quite worth that price, but you are getting the trip up the needle, which is worth $25 itself, you get to go to the observation deck, you get three courses, you get unlimited coffee/soda/juice, and the view while you eat. Great photo ops, too.,Anyway, it is a rare experience and well worth it."
"Excellent 360 views of the entire city. Getting to the top this Friday night for sunset was much easier than expected. Not congested, at all. The interactive boards awesome. You think of the Space Needle in Seattle as a must do and it definitely is. Don't miss it!"
"The guy working the front window was EXTREMELY rude to the customer in front of me. They were from Korea and I know this because I'm Korean & can speak the language. I understand that working with people you cannot communicate with is very difficult, however he should not have treated the customers the way he did. It was obvious that the customers did not understand, but the guy was yelling at the customers. When it was my turn to purchase the tickets he was very rude as well. If you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers. It brought down my mood & I wasn't able to enjoy the view because I felt bad for the foreigners... ,:("
"For crying out loud. ,$19.95 to go see views?!,Fine. Just this ONCE."
"Elevator broke down. We were stuck in a PACKED elevator for about an hour and thirty minutes. ,I will update the review once management contacts all of us with some type of compensation for the lost time. Interesting to see how customer service handles the incident. But for now, one star. ,If the elevator hadn't broken down, would have given this 3 stars. Interesting up top, but a bit overpriced for what it is."
"If you purchase the Seattle City Pass, you get two visits to the Space Needle (night time & day time), and it has to be used within twenty four hours of the first visit!,It's NOT a tourist trap at all! This iconic structure provides breathtaking views of the city! We decided to visit this landmark just before heading to dinner! There was no line, but if there was a line, City Pass holders are able to skip ahead.  Upon entrance, someone greets you and pretty much checks purses and bags for weapons and other illegal items.,Just before you enter the elevators, they also take a picture of you, which you can access at the top of the tower and send it directly to your email! I thought this was pretty neat souvenir! The night time view of the city was very nice! It's amazing to see all the structures and tall buildings light up at night!, and watch the cars' & traffic move from all the way at the top!,---,We also did the day time visit to the Space Needle when the weather was a lot nicer! It was sunny but it was SOOOO windy up there, that it's almost impossible to walk all the way around the outside part of the viewing area! Nevertheless, we enjoyed the view of the city and we took lots of great pictures!,Besides the elevator ride up the Space Needle, you can also enjoy their ""rotating restaurant"", and their HUGE gift shop downstairs! We decided to skip the restaurant since we already had a set plan for lunch and dinner! Overall, if you have an hour to spare during your trip in Seattle, then stop by here and enjoy the views!"
"Definitely a picturesque view, but very touristy. This is one of those things you have to go and see, but there really isn't a lot to do once you go up. The tickets for the elevator ride and view were over $20 a ticket which I think is quite expensive and why I probably wouldn't go again. I'm also not sure if I would recommend it - the view itself is fantastic like I previously said and I snapped some amazing pictures, but Seattle definitely has a lot more to offer."
"It is what it is. It's the Space Needle. It's a tourist attraction simply because you can get better views of the city at many other places but people will pay $16-$19 (depending on if you purchased the combo deal) to go up the space needle. We were no exception. We paid up and went up the needle just to say we've done it. Honestly if there are any more future visits to Seattle, I would pass on this and go to Kerry Park. Just as beautiful and totally free. It's sort of fun going up the needle though because you do get to see out the window as you ascend. Once you're up on top, you walk around and maybe drink some coffee and soak in the view. ,I think I might have enjoyed the observation deck more if it wasn't so cold up there. I heard from my friends who came here during the summer that the line to go up the space needle was outrageous. We came on Spring break and it was raining horizontally so that might have explained why the line wasn't bad at all for us. There is the famous spinning restaurant here too but it's obviously going to cost you. My cousins who have dined here before told me that the food is mediocre at best so we passed on the restaurant. There's too many good places to eat in Seattle. Overall, I'm glad I went up just to say that I've been here but there probably won't be a next time for me. 3/5"
Great tourist attraction to visit and it was within walking distance from our hotel.  Breath taking view of Seattle 360 degrees.  We took some nice pictures and the results were fantastic!
"Just like San Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge, Florida has Disneyworld, and Hawaii has ts beautiful beaches.  Seattle is known for its Space Needle, and is simply a must visit.  Offering a panoramic view of the entire city from a such an elevated location is breathtaking.  If you eat inside the restaurant, admission is free.  I really liked that there are telescopes all along the outside of the Needle.  The best part is that they are free.   They are really good telescopes too, and not the cheap blurry kind.  One is actually able to see inside hotel rooms if you really wanted to be a creeper.  ,I can imagine how crowded this place can get.  Luckily, we ate lunch here, and there were not too many people.  I wonder how nice the view is at night.  I would love to see it then."
A must see when visiting Seattle. We were pleasantly surprised with the great views of Seattle. We used our Citypass and could go up during the day and again at night. It is amazing how you can see almost all of Seattle from the top.   They have free mounted binoculars at the top. The interactive touch screen was fun. You can control cameras to see both sides of the Space needle in time elapse. Very safe for families and kids. We went on a weekday to avoid the long lines.
"Breath-taking, relaxing, exciting, lovely, romantic, heaven, peaceful, mind-blowing, outrageous, all in one. The Space Needle is truly an amazing attraction here in Seattle. The elevator ride up was smooth and quick, the stores and bathrooms were spotless, and the customer service was excellent! The young adults working here are full of energy and want to answer any questions about the tower. The observation deck was something special. There are wires and bars to keep people in place and theres no windows/glass to block anyone! This means the true air from the sky flows directly to the crowd from on top! This is such a great experience! It feels as if you're floating in air! ,Overall the Space Needle is great destination for anyone visiting and is a must-see location. It's worth the ticket price!"
"Have I been to the top?  Nope.,Would I pay to go to the Observation Deck?  Nope.  At those high prices, you better make sure it's a clear day!  I recommend the Smith Tower or Columbia Tower Observation Decks for a more reasonable price with similar views.,(Maybe I'd consider the SkyCity restaurant for a cocktail and free views).,Do I appreciate it's presence and existence?  Sure do!,Why I love the touristic Space Needle?  It's a true, one-of-a-kind Seattle landmark with the history of being designed by architect John Graham for the Seattle World's Fair on April 21, 1962.,With all this said, why 5-stars?,Whether you call it the Space Needle, ""Space Noodle"" as the Asian next to me referred to it, or any other combination of words, they have a fun LED Christmas tree on top of the Holidays so you can spot it from almost anywhere in the Emerald City.,Simply for the New Years Eve Fireworks, it was worth my visit since Seattle is my new home.  Starting at the 100 foot mark and continuing up the entire 605 feet, fireworks are utilized to light up the majority of the base, but also the UFO structure.  The eight-minute show was perfectly timed to the local artists, Pearl Jam and homeboy Macklemore.  The massive (yet fairly peaceful) crowds were worth battling for the night-time spectacular.  I'm still blowing my nose the day after to try and expel all the pot-smoke, but it was a New Years to go down in the books.  Check!,Check out my video of the New Year's Show here: "
"I actually remember the grand re-opening of Central Library back in '93 when I was six years old.  Now that it's been a lovely 15 years and now that I'm 21, it's great to reminisce what LAPL has given me throughout the years--  Story times at Children's Literature, Reading clubs in Teen'scape, a wide variety of test prep books, a pseudo-museum exhibit, and now, some books that I need for college!  It has great parking for it being in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles ($1 for All-Day  with validation on weekends) and the architecture is beautiful.  Definitely visit this place at least once in your life.  For someone who holds plenty of library cards from other cities/counties, this is actually one of the few/only libraries that still don't charge you for borrowing a certain popular book/entertainment DVD!"
"The Central Library hosts wonderful lecture series; I recently saw Chip Kidd give a PowerPoint presentation. Perhaps the funniest free performance I've seen all year.,The history section includes a voluminous section on travel guides and media. I was expecially pleased to find old tapes of Rick Steves guiding viewers through Europe.,The literature section is buried deep on the third floor and it's not uncommon to pass by an entire section where homeless individuals are napping on the comfy couches. It reminds me of my college days (the sleeping on couches in a library thing, not being homeless).,Lastly, the gift shop is one of the few places downtown where I could easily spend my weekly allowance on funny magnets, deliciously pretty wrapping paper and cute toys and books for my kid nephews. The merchandise is rotated frequently, meaning you can drop in every few weeks and see something new each time. Go now and get some crazy Dia de los Muertos t-shirts.,**EDIT**,Now I remember why I had to only give them 4 stars...,They have the slowest circulation desk staff ever! Argh! Ooouhh! It's slower than the post office. Slower than that woman on the escalator who won't walk when 8 people are standing behind her. I'm not kidding. Checking out/in at the desk or paying a fine? Bring a book, it's gonna be a while!"
"Of course when in Seattle, it's a must to go to the Space Needle! I felt like I was at Disneyland waiting in line for Space Mountain, but without an endless line and fussy children. Although there were a lot of people, it was organized well with where people had to stand and how many people were allowed in the elevator. ,I thought it was great that the elevator had glass windows so you could see all of Seattle while going up and down to the needle. It was a very windy day so being outside at the top was not very fun, but I still enjoyed taking in the views from inside. I thought it was very cute and clever as I saw numerous couples on dates up there. ,I saw a saying at the Space Needle that said, ""If you can only see one place in Seattle, why not see everything."" This is a great way to see views of Seattle from up above and you won't be disappointed!"
"my favorite library in the world.,they have all books, some dvds, videos. ,if i dont find what i want, i wont get it at anywhere.,parking is $1 or $2 after 4pm, which is great in the downtown.,i like borrowing history, biography dvds. it is ok to return it to other libraries nearest you. wonderful services."
"I swear, Fulton County seems to have gotten it together when it comes to processing auto tags. I bought a new vehicle back in December and there was no wait to pick up my new tag. It has been five months and my renewal is due and it took less than 23 minutes to park the car and then return with the paperwork. How do I know, I only had enough change to put 23 minutes in the meter... It's like seeing a unicorn;) To top it off, it was during the lunch hour!"
"Ventured here with a friend on a Saturday morning in search of a new study spot outside of Westwood.  So happy that they have easy parking right next to the library ($1 flat rate on Saturdays, it's more expensive during the weekdays).  There are plenty of well-lit tables, cubicles, and outlets all throughout.  Big windows to the outside world are a plus when studying during finals week.  Overall pretty quiet too, not shuffley and restless like a typical college library.,I would love to check out their DVD collection one of these days.,MInus one star for the extremely fragrant homeless person I was unfortunate enough to walk behind on my way in.  But hey, its a public library."
"Incredible views from the observation deck, just take your time and be patient as it's usually a bit crowded and everyone wants a pic, but still worth it. If you're interested in eating, go to Sky City for food and you can pop up to the observation deck for free while you wait for your table."
"I finally got to visit family I'm Washington and the Space Needle was on my ""To Visit"" list. It was about 30 degrees when we got to Seattle and I really wasn't thinking about how much colder it would be once we get to the top.  I was just simply excited! ,We had the city pass so we didn't have to stand in line to buy a ticket. So we walked to the entrance where they check tickets and your bag.  A few steps ahead was where they took your picture in front of a green screen- which you could pick 1 free photo from the backgrounds of the Space Needle and of Seattle. ,The wait for an elevator was just a few minutes. Once you're in the elevator and going up the speaker gives you some information about the Needle and the view of Seattle. You are able to ask questions too if you had any. ,I am deathly afraid of heights, but I like to test my limits. So this was something I have always wanted to see. When the elevator door opens you're welcomed into a warm room where they sell snacks, beverages and other goodies. ,The moment we stepped OUTSIDE to see the view, my face was nearly frozen. It was SOOOO cold. But the view was amazing so I sucked it up. If I lived in Washington I would come up here as much as I could. Before leaving, we stood in line to pick out the picture we wanted and they send it to an email. Going down, the elevator opens to the area where you can buy souvenirs. ,So I had a great experience. And I wouldn't mind coming back her."
"This is a beautiful library, with an amazing collection.  I've come here often to read, browse, and study since moving downtown.,There are a few drawbacks, though:,1)  On more than one occasion I've checked out books that have had insane or racist screeds scrawled in pen across the margins--things that had nothing to do with the book's content.  In one book, someone had systematically blacked out every single word that had to do with god, Christianity, and religion.,2) At one point, I was followed around the stacks by a creepy guy who kept telling me over and over again how he liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories because they ""made him laugh and laugh."",3) Many of the bathrooms have people actually bathing in them.,4) There is always at least one person in every reading reading room who sounds like they are dying of tuberculosis."
History is always awesome. Give yourself plenty of time to get thru security.
"Beautiful!! ,If you go make sure to get the City Pass so you can save a little bit of money but if you are going to just the Needle, they you might want to take a look into getting the Space Needle + Chihuly Glass Museum ticket. Only about $35, you get to check out the views from the top of the Needle and then go to the Glass Museum and check out the awesome different things there. ,Make sure you go to the Needle on a clear day and try to time it right otherwise, you won't get much of a view out to Pike's, The Great Wheel and all around. You get to stay up there as long as you wish. They also have a cafe there too if you want to have a quick little lunch without having to spend much."
"So much to see here, lots to do.  A bit disappointed we paid for the tickets in advance to ensure we were able to get inside.  The tour was only 30 mins and we only saw 2 rooms (we were not given the opportunity to see the upstairs).  Our tour guide was very animated and made the tour interesting with many unknown facts.  The grounds were beautiful and well maintained too."
"3.5 stars for this Needle,So high!!!! What I meant so high up in the air!!! haha,Family visit to the needle, son was more on the fence of not going cause he had to wait in line, once he got to the top he did not want to leave, spent a good hour circling the top used almost every single binocular offered on the outside deck, ,view is spectacular if visibility is good, we went on a day where it was muggy but we could see everything. Again place you go just to say you have been, son loved the binoculars on all angles of the outside deck, If you are in the area I do recommend you visit if you have kids, if you don't have kids not sure if you want to wait in line to see the landscape of everything, but if on vacation why not,mark your territory on the touch board that is, you put in an address and it forever saves it so anyone that visits types in your last name and it will mark how far you are from the needle, also large touch screens of several pictures, kids have a field day on selecting, smearing, punching, hulk smashing always comedy when you see kids on these boards, like a ipad on crack!!! hahaha,Food $$$ did not sample but the prices are really high considering the view I guess you can say it is worth it.,price $$ $20 to go up,service *** in a cow line waiting to go up and when to go down, even cow lines to get to the bathrooms smh hahha tourist attraction for sure,ambiance **** very clean, great view if it is clear"
"Why 3 stars? Because I guess you kinda have to do it?,   ---   ---   ---,When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in Washington, do as the Washingtonians do? Is that what they're called? ,Well, we waited. And we waited. And then we waited some more. Said waiting occurred around 1030am on a Friday in July. Not exactly when I would expect the tourists to be out in such a dominant force. But then again, I come from a place where July sucks... I'm sure many southern travelers like myself, left the miserable summer to enjoy the lovely light-jacket Seattle weather. Sucks that they all decided to go on the Space Needle the same day as we did!,As far as tall look-out points go, I've seen better."
"What can you say about being about 13 stories in the area with a 360 view on a gorgeous, sunny day?  Yes!  It's awesome.  ,Definitely bring a jacket/coat no matter what the weather because it can get fairly windy on the walk around the outside.,There is a cafe and plenty of seating on the inside and although I didn't eat there I heard the hot dog is pretty good.  Saw this as part of the City Pass which I highly recommend...it gets you expedited entry and that means you can bypass a lot of people sometimes.,You can stay up as long as you want."
"What a view!  I could see the city of Seattle at 360 degrees and with the city pass, it was discounted and we're able to ride the elevator to enjoy the scenic views once at daytime then another at night.  Depending on the time and day, the line could take from 20 minutes to a whole hour.  They have a person at the elevator with basic information about the history of the space needle.  There's no time limit being up there so we could take our time taking pictures.  They also take free pictures before going up in the elevator and a camera to take a group picture of the city and Mount Ranier in the background on a clear day."
"One recent review said ""been there done that"" and that is what I would say. The lines are ridiculous and not because they have to be. The place is poorly managed. We bought the City Pass & presented our tickets in 3 different lines & got 3 different sets of instructions for entrance. When we finally got in, there was no less than 4 ticket check points.   The view does not justify the wait. If you enjoy being in a crowded elevator, this is the place! Others have said you have to do the touristy things, but I'm but so sure about this one. There are many beautiful points of interest in Seattle, but this is not one I would recommend."
"I think typically you're not supposed to like the touristy spots in your hometown. For me that's Pike Place, the Piers...and the Space Needle. ,However, screw that. The Space Needle is awesome. You go up infinity feet, you get a 360 feet view of the gorgeous city that is Seattle. What else do you need? NOTHING. ,Oh, they do a fabulous fireworks show all timed to music for holidays. ,And the ride up is free if you want to stay awhile at the revolving restaurant.,I'm a born & bred Seattlite (residing in PDX!) and this place still rocks."
"Another  off the bucket list! ,Went up at night and the view was spectacular. I'm quite sure it's just as amazing or more amazing during the day. The price was kinda steep IMHO though, about $20.,There was alot of info and tidbits throughout the building. A place you MUST visit when you hit Seattle."
"A landmark that truly defines the Seattle skyline, the Space Needle is something that harkens back to an age when people regularly gathered in a single place just to catch a glimpse of the future at a World's Fair. However, there's something timeless about the design that doesn't make one think it's a relic leftover from a bygone era. Plus it's been updated and modernized, with a touchscreen wall that lets you indicate your hometown, and shows graphically how many people from cities the world over have visited. It also throws up little sayings periodically, like the total number of visitors but only one of which was Elvis Presley."
"I already reviewed the Sky City restaurant, amazing, so this will strictly review the observation deck and mainly give tips.,I made my way atop the Space Needle both during the day and at night, and of the two I found the daytime view much more enjoyable and fascinating. At night you are able to see lights, but during the day you are able to see mt. Rainer along with the mountain range, the waters, the greenness, and all of the city. ,There's a cafe that's sells food and drinks, nothing fancy and a little overpriced. Other than that there isn't really much else inside. I've been to some observation decks that have interactive displays and info on the surroundings, but this one was lacking in my opinion. ,As for tips, here we go.,1. Ticket price is $24 per adult. Eating at Sky City restaurant up top requires a minimum of $25 purchase per person and with your meal you also get access to the observation deck. You would be better off going up and getting some food or drinks at the restaurant for only $1 more instead of paying just for access to the deck. ,2. Eating at the restaurant also gives you access to a different elevator that doesn't have the long line of people waiting for the the observation deck. ,3. Sky View Observatory is another observation deck located at the Columbia Center building that is nearly twice the height and half the price. ,Space needle is a cool place to check off your Seattle to-do-list, but wasn't anything spectacular, unless you eat at Sky City, which I highly recommend. Check out my review on that to see why. ,Thanks for reading!"
"Worth the money to do the 2 trips in one day...one during the day and the other at night.  My kids absolutely love this!  The staff was great and the view is phenomenal from the observation deck.  Loved that there was a Starbucks inside.  ,Definitely worth doing at least once!"
"I felt like I was in a 50's film while on this thing. Like this was what they expected the future to be like. A great view and a great feeling while i was here. ,If you're going to Seattle this is a must. For yorself, your signifcant other, kids, etc. ,I really enjoyed this place."
"Expensive, but let's face it you can't not go.,It is THE touristy thing to do and everyone should do it once even though it won't exactly blow your mind. The view is great and there are binocular stands you can peek through. Perfect selfie backdrop, of course. ;),From the top you can scope out all the neat things below to visit.,The International Fountain is cool! There are two huge spiders on the top of one building that freaked us out... The Science Museum looked like it had interesting grounds with water and walkways. The EMP Museum was shimmery and bizarre. ,Loved seeing the ships and sailboats in the harbor!"
"Yes, but don't fall for the trial offer for the pimsleur language DVD's. We've cancelled repeatedly, changed our debit card number, been promised they will stop sending new sets, moved twice, and we just refused another package from the mailman yesterday."
"I haven't been to this library since I was a young adult.  I'm anxious to see what renovations have been done since the big fire.  I was unable to pre-register online for a library card today.  Got message that the ""service was temporarily unavailable."
"""You Know You're In Seattle...."",SITREP,Buildings are the soul of the city and provide the visual character of where you live.  And in some cities, there is a structure that is iconic enough that just to SEE it, and you know where you are at:  the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, and the Space Needle.  [I bet I didn't even need to mention the city, because as soon I mentioned the structure, you KNEW what city I was talking about.,THE SETUP,The Space Needle is near and dear to my heart having spent much of my life around it.  And luckily for me, no matter what city I was living in, my mom would make sure we would take a trip to see the iconic structure of whatever metropolis we found ourselves in.,We went up the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building together.  A high school trip later took me up the Twin Towers, now just a painful memory.  We also walked up the Washington Monument.  So getting to the top of the Space Needle was another very accomplished journey of personal conquest. ,THE VIEWS,On a beautiful day with crystal blue skies, the view of the Pacific Northwest that you can take in from atop the Space Needled is absolutely breathtaking.  I've been very lucky to look Northward towards Vancouver, Westward over the many isles of the Puget Sound, and toward the Southeast to see Mt. Ranier in all it's majesty.,THE LOWDOWN,The Space Needle is well worth the trip up in the elevator to see some great sights over the beautiful city of Seattle."
"Most of LA's 80 branch libraries are pretty dinky, but a trip to the Central Branch will explain that: this place has got everything. 7 stories of books (4 of which are underground) -- from old telephone directories from the '20s to everything coming out today, & all the goodies in between. There really hasn't been much that I couldn't find at Central. As for events: The ALOUD series of lectures addresses subjects appealing to the entire spectrum of library patrons, but they have all kinds of adult, teen and computer literacy programs as well. And the AMAZING architecture of the building does justice to all the awesome inside."
"Let me tell you that I put off coming here for as long as possible.  I know how it usually goes down with governmental agencies:  you wait in line for forever, you go up to the counter to find some rude heifer who tells you she can't help you because you don't have some piece of paper that wasn't listed on the website, you have to leave and come back to do the whole thing over again.  I started my adventure on a Wednesday afternoon forty minutes before closing.  After parking in the lot designated for Fulton County governmental blah blah building ($7/30min), I walked past some sketchy characters to the building without any harm.  I make it to the security check point...I have my taser with me, and no, they won't hold it for me, I have to return it to my car.  So, yes, I just moved from Mayretta and the big city still frightens me.  I have a taser.  No, I haven't tased myself.  So, I have to speed walk to my car and speed walk back.  I fly through the metal detectors and race up to the tag office.  I didn't have to wait and talked to two different counter-ladies and they were both extremely nice and efficient!  I was BLOWN AWAY.  If I hadn't brought my big, bad taser, I would have been in and out in less than thirty minutes.  I was only accosted once for change, and it was by a guy that was multitasking as a parking attendant/windshield cleaner/bum.  Impressive!"
"Went here to do a little studying today.  ,PARKING,You can park in the Flower St structure.  It is shared w/ the US bank building, the Standard Hotel, etc (hoping I was going to run into a celebrity in the elevator).  I thought the parking was a buck on weekends w/ library validation. It is BUT you need a library card.  Did not know that, and the information lady wasn't going to let me slide.  And I didnt' want to sign up for one.  Paid $8 for parking, which made me a lil upset because I went to the library to avoid spending $8 on frappuccinos and muffins at starbucks.  ,FACILITY:,The grounds are gorgeous, since I was paying $8 for parking anyway, I decided to take in the scenery.  The courtyard that faces Flower street is gorgeous.  The inside is a giant work of art too.  There are galleries tucked away between collections, and large murals adoring the ceilings in the forums.  First thing i thought was WOW, and then starting taking pictures like a tourist. . . . ,WI-FI,Maybe it was just that day, but it was really slow.  Almost like dial up.  I was taking a test online and it timed me out.  So definitely don't recommend it if you are ... taking online exams.,COMING BACK?,Yeah, but I'm taking the metro next time."
Can't visit Seattle without seeing the space needle. When we first visited 10 years ago we stayed on the ground. This trio we got up our nerve and went to the observation deck. I'm so glad we did!  It was awesome and not nearly as terrifying as I expected.  Beautiful views of course and the staff was friendly and engaging!
"We had the 3 course brunch last Saturday and I was very pleased. Had the biscuits and gravy for the first course and an eggs benedict concoction for the second course. We had just returned from an Alaskan cruise but I could argue the eggs benedict with crab might have been the best thing I ate all week long. ,Service was excellent and the views fantastic. They even took a picture of our group without charging us an arm and a leg like every other tourist attraction. Put this on the top of your Seattle ""to-do"" list.  ,Only negative I can think of is there is some sort of dry ice dessert concoction that wasn't on our brunch menu. I'm the type of guy that ALWAYS orders the food that spews fog. What has 2 thumbs and neither has frostbite? I think you know."
"I haven't checked-out a book yet, but I like visiting here because of the accessible location downtown and historic architecture. It's nice to hang-out at a library besides my familiar, academic haunts at USC. So why is it worth checking out? It's huge, quiet, and also has cool, museum-like exhibits. If you're planning to explore downtown--which you should do whether or not you're a tourist!-- this is a must-see."
"It would be anti-American to give Independence Hall a low rating. I picked up the free tour tickets at the Visitors center a block away. Since the tours were 20 minutes apart, I assumed the tour was 20 minutes. It was 40 minutes... and honestly it was difficult to stay awake but people kept saying I had to see these things while I was in Philly so there you go."
"Winds strong enough to swoop away a small child and even tumble some adults, it goes without saying that Space needle is a ""must-go"" for anybody here for even a day. ,I went just before sunset on a cloudless sky and got an amazing view of Puget sound, downtown Seattle and SLU (didn't like Queen Anne)"
"This place is pretty awesome, especially if you like history. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site; even the UN likes it!,To tour the actual building, you need to get tickets in the visitor's center. They're free in person, or a small fee online. You have a better chance of getting the time you want online, but they're free in person. The Liberty Bell is in its own building between the visitor's center and the Hall. I liked the parts that explained how the bell got so cracked, and how it became such an enduring symbol. But also it is kind of hard to get really excited about a bell.,There are lots of neat things to do nearby, too, like see the oldest post office in the USA (still running! they have their own special hand-cancelled postmark). The Independence Hall gift shop in the visitor's center has a great selection of postcards, reasonably priced. Much cheaper than across the street at the Bourse and of course your purchase here benefits the Park Service."
The Space Needle is worth a visit to be a typical Seattle tourist. I ain't ashamed ;) Best parts - you can buy a beer at the top and they also don't try to nickel and dime you (the photos they take for you are free!). Worth coming to fulfill your obligatory tourist duties.
"I like the retro architecture of the space needle, but 20 minutes of standing in line and $19 per person to ride the elevator to the top did not do much for me.  I would have skipped it, had we not had my son in tow.  Now that we've gone to the top, I'm good for life I think...but had I realized that you needed to make reservations ahead if you wanted to do the revolving restaurant rather than the observation deck, I probably would have done so.  We were there in the morning and the earliest same day reservation for the restaurant was 9pm.,A few weeks ago they opened a Chihuly Garden ""museum"" at the base of the space needle and now they sell a combo ticket.  Separately each entrance is $19 for adults.   You save $5 (at any level ticket) if you buy them both together.  When we were there the Chihuly line was much shorter.  Chihuly's colorful glass sculptures are fabulous, so I do recommend you see that exhibit if you are going to the space needle."
A classic tourist spot. Tremendous view of Seattle and afar. Expensive but good to try once. Visited during high winds and had to hold onto my hat tightly. Free digital copies of photos atop the needle are a plus.
"Super cool place to visit if you're in Seattle and it's sunny.  I'm not too sure how the experience is when you're dealing with the regular overcast weather but I was fortunate enough to come when the skies were clear.  I wish I could have seen the city at night but that will have to be on another visit.  Nonetheless I am still amazed by this tourist attraction and I would encourage anyone to swing by and visit.  ,Tip:  Don't fear long lines or long wait times since they have a timed system which allows you to choose certain groups to go with every 30 minutes.  This helps the traffic flow SOOOO much more efficiently than simply waiting in a general line like before."
Absolutely iconic. Went to the top after a great dinner at Sea Star; it has such a beautiful night view. Have a glass of wine or champagne at the top and do a lap. Can't take drinks out on the observation deck though. Worth doing every few years or taking out of town relatives.
"I came here while visiting Seattle and enjoyed every minute of it! It really is a must see if you are visiting!,It is pricey to take the elevator to the top but what touristy landmark isn't?! Elevator was pretty fast!,It can get crowded at times. I was here before the sun was setting and stayed until it set. Buy a drink or two and just enjoy the views!,There is a gift shop as well but you can bet it will be pricey. Some cool stuff though."
"The Space Needle was a nice view, but I still would have enjoyed my trip without it. We went on a cold and rainy day (our whole trip was like that). Fortunately the fog still allowed for some visibility of nice sites but it was so cold and wet we didn't stay outside on the observation deck for very long. When you get on the elevator try to get a spot close to the window so you can see the sights as you go up. Snacks and drinks up at the top can be a bit pricey and options are limited, but it's fine if you wanted to grab a tea or coffee while you gaze out over the city. ,I highly recommend purchasing the combo ticket for access to BOTH the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden $34/pp. The Chihuly garden is phenomenal-who doesn't love to look on in awe of Chihuly's remarkable glass work! Both sites have professional photographers taking pictures that you can email to yourself for free!"
"My tourist friend wanted to come here so it was my first visit despite having lived here for quite a long time. ,We did the night time ride for $17 on a Saturday night. We went at 9:30 and it was just when the sun went down. How perfect! This was actually cooler than I expected. Sure, its a tourist trap but the view is quite beautiful and its worth going up at least once. ,The exhibition and information inside was not very interesting so I didn't bother with it but I really enjoyed hanging out on the observation deck. ,Logistics: ,The lines weren't too long and we spent about an hour there."
"Some cool facts about the Space Needle:,*Opened since April 21, 1962, the Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, a landmark of the Pacific Northwest, and a symbol of Seattle. ,*Was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors, when nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators.,*It is 605 ft high, 138 ft wide, and weighs 9,550 tons. ,*It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude ,*It has 25 lightning rods,*It has an observation deck at 520 ft and a gift shop with the rotating SkyCity restaurant at 500 ft ,*From the top of the Needle, one can see not only the downtown Seattle skyline but also the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay, and surrounding islands. ,*Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at 10 miles per hour. ,*The trip to the top takes 41 seconds. On windy days, the elevators slow to 5 miles per hour. ,*On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated it a historic landmark,At first, I was seriously debating on whether or not to go on Space Needle. The weather didn't look too good and I didn't want to pay an entrance fee just to be at the top and realize that fog would cover up the views. But it was one of those things where you just don't know unless at you're at the top, so we took the risk anyway. I mean we're already here in Seattle and for the time being it wasn't raining. ,Admission prices vary depending on whether you're a youth (ages 4-12), regular (ages 13-64), or senior (ages 65+) and also what time of day you go (early, mid-day, up late, or anytime). Anytime ticket being the most expensive for all ages. ,Admission for me would have been $20ish for an up-late ticket but someone we had just met in line gave us a Seattle Citypass so I didn't have to pay. It caught me off guard but yes we did thank them. Unfortunately I ripped it from the book which automatically made it invalid (I wasn't supposed to rip it). However, the employee at the entrance still let me through which was nice.,The elevator ride to the top was very smooth. It was packed with other guests but luckily no one stepped on each other.,The weather was so windy when I went outside on the observation deck that it became nearly impossible to walk the whole circle. We walked around for a bit and took some pictures from the observation deck overlooking the city. It was a gorgeous view but incredibly windy. ,You can also enjoy the view of the city from the inside of the Space Needle. We ordered some food at the cafe and sat for a while looking at the view outside.  ,Hours are Monday - Sunday from 8:00am - 12:00am and it's pretty much open all year unless there is a special event and/or facility upgrades.,The Space Needle is definitely worth checking out if you're doing a first trip to Seattle or if you like city views. I mean where else would you be able to get a 360 degree view of Seattle? Plus, the Space Needle is an amazing building in itself. It also helps to plan to go when you know the weather looks good!"
Landmark in Seattle that you cannot miss.  Great view of Seattle.  We  bought a city pass which allow us to enter the second time within 24 hours.  We can have the day view and night view of the city.
"The Space Needle is a must do when you visit Seattle. My first visit was about six years ago and things were mighty different when buying your ticket to ride the giant elevator to the top. I haven't gone up the Needle in a couple years, but let others enjoy the ride while I sit at the bottom and stare up at the beauty. Really, it is just as pretty to stare at the Needle as it is looking at the Seattle skyline. ,I think that now you have to buy tickets for a certain time and wait in another line until your time to enter. Maybe that is just during the busy summer months or maybe it is now just how things tend to be.,The view is worth seeing and the money is worth spending to brag to everyone that you've been in the Space Needle. Also, the gift shop below does have some pretty neat stuff to buy all those friends you'll be bragging to."
"One of the iconic stops in the Seattle  area. Seen in many pictures and movie. This site is incredibly touristy. You can time it right to avoid lines on the viewing deck or pay some large amount to eat dinner. ,Weather plays a key part to enjoying this site. If it's foggy it is hard to enjoy around. If it's sunny one may encounter long lines. If it's summer you are likely to expect large waits. ,The site is reasonably priced and a great stop for the family. You can buy a Chiluli museum and needle pass for a slight discount.  ,Good: friendly helpful staff. ,Bad: ultra touristy and can expect long lines irregardless of time of year. ,Four stars. Worth enough for a few extra visits with family."
The most wonderful place in Downtown Los Angeles.
The first time I went here was for school because our English teachers wanted us to take advantage of this library. I am so glad that we did! The moment I stepped on to this place I fell in love.  I can't remember the last time that happened to me with books.  The staff here is great.  They would help me with anything that I needed even if I had no idea what I needed.  I think more importantly one of the reasons I love this place oh so much is because it's walking distance from the Metro Red Line.  Such a lifesaver!  This place will always hold a special place in my heart and I love coming back here when I can.
Meh what can you expect from a tourist attraction. Decent views lol and not much else. Staff was kinda rude n uneducated when it came to lining up to enter in regards to where and when to line up to enter. But I imagine it's going to happen when a ridiculous amount of people who visit.
"The LA library system is one of the most slept on things in Los Angeles.  Although I don't frequent this branch because I live a few blocks from the Echo Park branch and I usually just have anything I need put on hold and delivered there, the Central branch is still top notch.  I would suggest going on Sundays right when they open and finding free street parking.  I'm the type that avoids paying for parking at all costs, especially at a library."
"After having waited as long as 2 hours to take my motorcycle test at a CA DMV when I had an appointment, I thought things would be much better in GA.,I was wrong.  Very wrong.  Large government organizations apparently are screwed up everywhere.  I gave it two stars though, because the girl we dealt with was at least cool about the whole situation and helped my wife and I laugh through the ordeal.  Plus, at the end of the day, we both actually liked our license pictures.,Anyway, when my wife (who is a professional organizer) and I went to get our licenses less than a week after we moved to GA, we took our marriage certificate, old licenses from CA, current vehicle registrations, current smog certificates, birth certificates and social security cards for good measure, proof of insurance, the deed to the house to prove our residency, and even drove both cars separately just in case they needed to be inspected.  ,I thought we were ready for anything they could throw at us, but apparently not only do you need the right items, they must happen in the right order!  My wife gets a number for us, but they tell me I need one too, so I hand her the paperwork and sit down to wait while she's called to one of the many windows ahead of me.  ,In record time my wife comes back to the waiting area, but she's got a very pissed off look on her face.  Hesitantly I ask her what's wrong.  She says, ""I don't exist!""  ""Uhh....Excuse me??"" I mutter dumbfounded, ""How can you not exist?  You're standing right in front of me.""  ""Ask them!"" she pointed and huffed, handing me the paperwork and sitting down arms crossed like a grumpy two year old.  ,Now I was anxiously waiting next to her for my number to be called so I could find out what the problem was and calm her down some.  Turns out that in the great state of Georgia, my wife truly didn't exist according to the government because I bought the house in my name only.  Since she wasn't on the deed, and none of the bills were in her name, she couldn't prove her residency!,So here's the kicker:  Once I proved my residency with the deed of the house, and was processed through the system, she was able to use our marriage certificate to prove she was my wife, and by definition now a legal entity since I was, and thus was granted residency and ultimately, a driver's license.   Of course, we had to go to an entirely different building to get our vehicle tags, but that's a different story for another day.,The whole fiasco added about 30 minutes to what would have normally been a 10 minute process, but all in all, I was actually impressed that for an additional fee you can get your license valid for 10 years.  ,Not having to go back for 10 years....priceless."
"I have been a patron of this library since it opened. Every time I enter the building, it magically transport me to another world. It is an oasis in the middle of downtown. The architecture alone makes you stare and now that it is the holidays, the place is decked out in its finery. Check out the lovely tree on the 2nd floor. Instead of ornaments, it is filled with library cards. I just love the smell of pine as I walk through the library. And you are only a couple of blocks away from Persian Square where there is ice skating.,I have spent many times just walking around the library and discover new things each time.,Check out the used book sale the library host once a month. Get some books for a quarter a piece. Take a look at the library store - it is out of the ordinary. Go to the top floor and sit on the bridge. Take an escalator ride to each floor and walk among real books. ,Yes, there are homeless people. But this is downtown people. They have never been a problem. Have a heart and unless they are dangerous, leave them be. ,I do miss being able to go to the library any day of the week. Sunday was my favorite time because it wasn't as busy as Saturday. ,Why 5 stars? ,This is the best library - for the vastness of materials, the architecture, events and exhibits, the staff, and just for the ambiance of a big city library without having to travel to New York."
"We did a visit of the Space Needle during the day and also opted to visit again at night.  We spent well over 2 hours up on the observation deck.  There are a couple interactive things to do, in addition to the amazing sights of the city!"
"So. Seattle. Yeah, you have got to go see the Space Needle. It's a touristy thing, yes, but it's pretty damn cool.,Start by downloading the app on your smart phone. There's interactive ""spots"" that your phone can access. Looking at the spot via the app on your phone brings up a 5 foot 3D visual of the Needle. Take a selfie with it. Photograph someone else with it.  Pretty cool. There are different versions including a futuristic one complete with space ships!,There's also a couple that appear to be holes in the floor enabling you to see the elevator and birds, people, etc moving around down below (synched up with cameras underneath the restaurant that show the below view.,Once you've gotten that, get your ticket and head up. We bought city passes (discount collection of tickets to 5 locations) so our Space Needle tickets came with a return ticket. The two tix is great - visit during the day and again at sunset for brilliant views.,The 41 sec ride up elevator is an elevator unless you finagle front row standing - then you can watch the scenery through the windows - recommended.,Upstairs there's an exterior walkway all the way around -- your app includes a map with labelled landmarks! Makes it much cooler when you know what you are looking at.,It's a lovely view up there. The (free) telescopes make it fun to seek out close-ups of your landmarks too.  Inside are a bunch of interesting interactive activities - and the ability to scan your tix and email copies to yourself of the professional shot they take when you arrive.,Yeah, it's a bit pricey for what can be a short trip (although we easily lost 2 hours both visits and could have stayed longer) but it's a pretty unique and fun outting worth the money."
"It is a little pricey to get to the top of this place, 20 bucks a person but you get a nice view of the city. True some might say that the Columbia Center deck has a better view since your higher, you see the Space Needle in the skyline, and it's a lot cheaper, but the Space Needle has so much more to offer. ,The elevator ride up is nice, it's fast, and it's glass so you get the view of the city right away as your going up. Once your at the top you have a complete 360 degree view of the city. There are also a lot of things up here too from time lapse videos you can control that is shot from the Space Needle, a live camera you can control, and free telescopes to look through. It is nice you can even go to an outside deck and walk around and get some pictures.They even have food they sell up there along with tables to sit inside at and enjoy the view. ,Best of all there is no time limit that you can be up here, so you have plenty of time to enjoy yourself and take in the view."
Such a large and beautiful library! It reminds me of a university library!
"i HEART the library!  let the inner nerd in me boast of this wonderful achievement in our society...free books!  knowledge, stories, information abound and available to all residents of that region.  i can't help it, the feelings of comfort when i walk into a library.  the little girl inside of me that used to use the library as a refuge from the drama and stress of dealing with the social stratosphere in school, that little girl smiles and shoulders drop with a sense of relief as she enters the quiet space of the library.,the LA central library is an amazing 8 floor structure with beautiful artwork, a computer center, FREE WiFi, and a great user friendly system.  the icing on the cake is that its FREE for any CA resident!  great place to study and surprisingly clean in all areas.  as part of the territory of every public space, there are some people with questionable b.o. and some people in unfortunate homeless circumstances who use the bathrooms as an area to get cleaned up, but it's safe with security officers present during open hours.,case in point: as i studied and job searched today there was a harmless homeless man sitting at the table in front of me who farted, LOUDLY.  he looked around then pulled out a can of air freshener from one of his bags and sprayed the area behind him.  how thoughtful and considerate!  though i must admit it was hard to keep my laughter in. =D"
"Visiting independence hall in Philly is a must. It's a nice building in a beautiful and historic location. There is a brief security check, than you can enter the different buildings on the site. The main building can only be entered with a tour group that starts only at certain times (multiple per hour), but lasts 45 min."
"It was fun seeing the Space Needle, and going up. The panopticon view of Seattle is amazing, especially at night. When I went up, it was raining both times and very windy. So I highly recommend that you bundle up. It was hard to get pictures without feeling like you would lose your camera. ,Before you buy a ticket for the Space Needle, make sure you get the CityPass which enables you to see all the attractions within a number of days."
"Growing up outside of the States I didn't know much about the American history. I didn't even know the huge role Philadelphia played in the Declaration of Independence! We got tickets to visit the Independence Hall first thing in the morning - this is very important. The tickets are free but they sell out fast. We headed in about 20 minutes before our tour and took a look around the other buildings. The tour itself is great. The guides are very knowledgeable and it was a bit like a history lesson, which for Americans may be repeating stuff they already knew, but for many of the tourists in the room it was great - exactly what we needed! We learned about the history of the signing and then we headed to see the official documents and the room where it was all signed. I recommend everyone who is in Philly goes to check out the Independence Hall"
"The Space Needle. One of the most iconic structures in the world, especially in Seattle! Had to check it out when I was in Seattle.,We didn't make reservations but we walked up to the front counter, and luckily for us, we were able to get reservations for the next night because someone cancelled. Table setting was nice and decor was good. We got seated by the windows were we got views of the entire city. Menu was of course expensive. It was my first time getting an entree for 50-70 bucks per person. Food was alright, you are just paying for the experience of dining on a revolving restaurant, so can't really complain. ,Advice:,Visit the Glass museum next door, admission is $20, and everything is beautiful!"
"I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because the line management was some of the oddest I've seen in years.  And as I was in line for about an hour, I feel qualified to talk.  ,The view was amazing.  It is absolutely a must-do for a first time visitor to Seattle. We had tickets for a 9:30 viewing but due to how they queued up their guests and the number of visitors, we didn't actually get to the observation deck until closer to 10:30.    The sun was just about down and there were some clouds, but the view was completely stunning.  City lights, Puget Sound, mountains in the distance. ,The elevator to the top has a view of the outside.  There is an open air observation deck surrounding the glassed in viewing area.,One regret - we didn't visit the glass museum next door.  Maybe on the next trip."
"Here's the sitch: I never AND THE ROCK MEAN NEVER, do the traditional tourist things. I look at tourist traps as just a way to separate me from my hard earned money. So I only went here because I'd picked up the city pass and the cost was included. I was so pleasantly surprised, the Space Needle is awesome! The view is breathtaking and you can just sit on top of the world and watch the city go by. There's a free photo opportunity on the observation deck and a pretty passable snack bar. As a matter of full disclosure I don't know the exact cost (again get the City Pass) but for me it was definitely worth the trip. I was playing ""Top of the World"" by the Dixie Chicks my entire time up there, but I'm just weird like that :)"
"Went here for the first time ever in life (after walking and driving by so many times) and it was worth it. The view is amazing (reminded me of my trip to NY). We had City Passes but man the lines are not what's poppin. Tried to get a time to see the sunset but tourists dominated the lines. While waiting, we walked across the street to have some drinks and a quick bite to eat. We came back and our time slot was already full, (again!) so I had to tell my brother to switch his ticket to the next available which they were generous to do with no hassle. While waiting, we walked a few blocks to 1st Ave to kill time and grab more drinks. We made it back on time and the line was long again but I'm pretty sure our drinks made it seem shorter...,When we got up there, it was a little chilly and seemed like you walk around the needle fairly quickly. Still, it's a nice spot and has a cool touch screen wall, telling you how many visitors there have been since year 19xx."
"This is a must visit in Seattle. My friends and I went on a weekday and it was fairly crowded. The ticket line was huge, however, if you want to eat at the observation restaurant you can go inside and make a reservation at the gift shop and then bypass the lines. The elevator ride is very cool. You can take another elevator up or use the stairs. It's a short walk. There's a museum portion and food for sale inside and then the observation platform outside. The views are amazing. There's also a roaming photographer who will take your photo for free and you can have it emailed via the kiosk at the gift shop. It is crowded. We had to wait for some of the better spots to take photos. Not cheap either, but worth the price as it's a very unique experience. The views are just amazing."
"It's a historical landmark, what's not to love.  There's no activities to do once you're up there.  It's more of a picture opportunity and WOW what beautiful scenery.  Absolutely breath taking.  ,Want to know how to go up for free?  Eat in the restaurant which is really good anyways. If you're a tourist this is a must see.  It's so beautiful up there and it's give a 360 degree view of Seattle."
"So it's GREAT to take photos of this place from the ground... being up here isn't really a big deal. I got some great views and took lots of photos and it was romantic at night to be out there... but basically... that's it. It's just to view Seattle... I don't know how much you paid for it... but I'm glad I got a City Pass for this instead of an individual payment. ,We didn't eat at the restaurant because I heard the food was alright. I need good food when I travel... not just ""alright""... so we didn't eat there.,But the view was nice. My favorite part is taking a photo in front of the blue screen and having the image in the back. We got to hold a plastic fish. That was fun. We got to choose our background and email it to ourselves on the top. That was fun.,Of course... the elevator down leads you to the shopping area. They have Space Needle macaroni!!! Whaaaa!?!?,BATHROOMS in TOWERS: They have one on each side... prepare to wait for the bathroom on a busy season. ,DRINKS: They serve drinks and snacks on the top (of course you have to pay for it... and it's overpriced). ,NOTES:,* Get the City Pass. Not worth just individually buying this.,* You cannot email multiple backgrounds of that one photo you took on the bottom of the needle,* The shop is big, but overprices as usual,* At night, you'll just see lights from Seattle... kinda hard to take photos with the railing over you. So photos were hard. ,OVERALL:,Fun tourist thing to do. Lasts about 10 min or less. Unless you're going up there to think about your life. Other than that... it's just a view."
"On 3/13/15 @ 1130 we had an uncomfortable ride down in the space needed. A family boarded just as the door was closing and the guide ""M"" literally kicked the door back to keep it open. You could see he was unhappy about it. The family with kids asked to be let off one floor down at the restaurant and again he displayed his frustration. He said something quirky and a tad bit sarcastic upon their exit. ,He did find time to engage in conversation about unions with one lady that ask. Didn't seem happy that they didn't have one or something similar. I just wanted to get off as fast as possible.,Sorry if he was having a bad day but people come there with their kids and family to have a good time. Please advise the young man to grow up. ,$21 bucks a person isn't cheap"
I can only give the Space Needle 4 stars cause it isn't the kind of thing you probably need to do more than once. It's very touristy. They even dump you out after your viewing in the gift shop. They take your groups picture as you are entering and you can stop in and get the pic. Or you can log in later on your phone or computer and get the picture. I just took screen shots with my phone. It was cheesy but cute. The view is breathtaking at the top. You can have snacks and refreshments at the top.
"This place was an extremely disappointing experience. Just think through it before coming. The line up was about 15 minutes, no biggie, the line to get down was over 2 hours, and they said it was because it was so windy and not safe.,The thing that gets me about this is I respect the safety component of things, but what really get me is that they have a tiered pricing system so I've been waiting to get down from the needle for 2 hours as we speak, and some people just walked in front of everyone who has been waiting like me. Sad to see this elitist setup as what is described as a land mark, would not recommend, paid like 60 dollars for my wife and I to come up here for 20 minutes, apparently that doesn't buy a quality experience, it's a space needle not Swedish massage at a 5 star hotel."
"If you are asian then you know what I'm talking about when I say ""I need a good place to take a nap"". Like sometimes you just need to take a fucking nap man, like my friend Matthew Lee -- that kid falls asleep anywhere. Like one time he was doing the asian squat outside this theater and he straight up passed out and I was like ""what the hell Matthew Lee how do you keep balanced?"" and he told me it was because of all his fucking training and I was like ""you are hardcore asian, Matthew Lee"". Anyway...,So the Public Library is so big that you can like pass out without anybody really noticing that you aren't just ""looking at the pages really close because years of reading bio/chem textbooks in two languages has given you severe myopia"" or something like that. And that kind of privacy is key for taking naps in public places -- like I used to take naps in Leavey Library all the time and then one time this white kid all woke me up and got mad at me because apparently I was snoring or something all over my 2000 page bio/chem textbook -- and I was like ""what the hell?"" I mean did that kid have any idea what its like to have a hardcore korean grandfather on your ass every second you're at home to such an extent that you have to sleep every possible second you're away just to maintain homeostasis? I think not,they now serve boba in the cafe on B1"
"So i wanted to go here for so long, i even almost went to one of the speeches they had promoted in LA Weekly, but alas nope.,Luckily this weekend I was downtown for the Blessing of the Pets ceremony and was able to convince Aaron R. and my friend James that they should come with me to see it. Sure i thought it was the super cool library from City of Angels (anyone know where that one is?) and it wasn't but it was still sooo cool.,I lvoe teh ceiling of the rotunda and the chandelier with the goble is suepr awesome. They also had some cool art work in the Getty/Annenberg areas. And the odd Mobile Art in the new buildingis pretty interesting too from a sort of surrealist perspective.,Make sre to go across the street and up the stairs or elevators to looka t the roof from above. Very cool."
"Of course if it's your first time to Seattle, you'll want to visit the Spaceneedle. And I think you should.,Granted, it isn't amazing BUT it's worth seeing for an awesome 360° view of the city. ,Also, I love that you get 2 free photos that you can email to yourself. One is a photo taken in the beginning of the attraction. The second photo is taken outside. There is a machine to scan your admission ticket and it takes it from a high angle."
"i went to the BIG LIBRARY today because i needed one thing (a musical score that i needed for an audition).  i've been there before, but it's been awhile.  this place is HUGE.  it's like an amusement park for book-worms.  had i had more time, i would have browsed a bit more.  all-in-all, it's a great place.,but wouldn't you know it -- the one thing i needed -- which was supposed to be there -- was nowhere to be found.  urgh!!!,oh well, i guess it wasn't meant to be."
"Atlanta's MVD = pure hell.  Let me tell you my story.,I recently got into a collision that was totally not my fault.  Some guy in a massive Honda Ridgeline came and whacked my poor Hyundai Accent's bumper off while he tried to make a left out of a parking lot into oncoming traffic.  The APD officer wrote him a ticket, but while she was at it, she gave me a citation for not having my car registered in Georgia.  This is something that I never did after I graduated college here.  I didn't think this was a problem because the title was in my mom's name first and she lives in Florida, which another officer told me was totally fine before.  Apparently it's not.  I was given 30 days to register my car.,Thus begins Car Registration Hell Fest '07.,First, I checked the website for the necessary documents that I would need to bring.  Because the car is registered in my mom's name (who lives in FL) as well as mine, this makes it about 6 million times more difficult to register the car in Georgia.  We wanted to keep it in both of our names for insurance purposes (which we had to switch anyway, raising my insurance by $75 per month), so she had to sign and notarize a power of attorney paper and send it to me along with a copy of her driver's license and a utility bill from the month of her birthdate.  After I got all of this together, I called the office to make sure I had everything.  Oh my, no.  I also needed a copy of my lease to prove when I moved here and my FL registration (which is not listed on the website).  My registration was in my car which was at the repair shop, so that was a hassle.  As for my lease, my landlord was away in la la land, so I had to dig up what I had, some sort of addendum with a later date.,I got to the office, and at this point I only had a week left to register the car after getting all of these documents together.  The lease addendum wasn't good enough for them, and my regular lease wouldn't have been either.  They needed a lease from the first time I moved here so they can charge me back taxes for all the time I haven't had my car registered here, which would be about $500.  But I moved here for college, I explained, and one is not required to have their car registered here if they're in college.  They said that I would need a transcript issued within the last 30 days to prove this.  But  my school hasn't existed in a year, I protested...I was in the last graduating class of Atlanta College of Art before they merged with SCAD.,The solution to this was to have my mom sign the car over to me during the current month, thus avoiding the back taxes.  I sure wish they had told me this in the first place.  Keep in mind that I only had a week before my court date at this point.  So I rushed over to the USPS and sent the title to my mom with overnight Express Mail.  After dealing with major post office issues, she was finally able to sign it over and overnight it back to me and I promptly took the thing down to the MVD once again with one day to spare before traffic court.,Amazingly, there were not as many people at the Dresden Drive office, and I was served right way by a really really nice guy, and everything was fine.  He is the reason that I'm giving 2 stars instead of one.  All of my documents were fine, and I didn't even need to give a blood sample or sign a form promising my first-born to the MVD!!!!  I walked out of there with a license plate and registration within 20 minutes.,Whew.  All I'm saying is that if you people really want us to register our cars in Georgia, you need to make it a hell of a lot easier from the beginning.  Take a lesson from Florida.  I can't stand that state, but they sure do know how to handle vehicle registration a million times better than this one."
BEAUTIFUL place to visit. The only thing that could be better is convenient parking.
"*31st Birthday Spot*,And what a nice birthday weekend in Seattle it was!  I had mixed thoughts on going to the needle, as we had just come from the Eiffel Tower a few months ago, but I left really satisfied with the whole experience.,The staff is great, polite and everything went so smoothly. Every time we had a question, people were ready to help with a smile.,I would definitely recommend buying your tickets online to skip some of the lines.  It's really easy!  All you do is just buy them your phone and then they scan with the bar-code.  QUICK!  If you pair this with the ticket for the Chihuly Glass place - it's great.,While in line, there are screens with facts, walls with facts, and other stuff to look at.  I loved this because I just really enjoy trivia.  Plus, it kills time pretty well!  The line doesn't take too long - half hour?  Then, you shuffle into a pretty nice elevator and up you go.  WHOOSH!  The ride up is pretty breathtaking on the way up and BAM - you are there.,On the top you can use the telescopes for free, there is an interactive APP to place with, wall screen to touch, trivia to investigate, a spot that will take your picture and BEAUTIFUL views.  We spent quite a bit of time up there and it was truly enjoyable.  I can even see myself going again next time in town because it was so nice.,Worth the time and price.,Memorable experience.,LOVELY.,*There are so many cool pieces of art to see from the top - really neat!"
"The Space Needle was one of the best parts of my Seattle vacation. The staff was pleasant, which I believe is a very important part of any attraction. Most importantly, the view was absolutely phenomenal. The interactive screens made learning about the Seattle area and uploading personalized Space Needle pictures quick, easy, and fun. I had a wonderful time, and would love to go back!"
"I've lived in Los Angeles for 100 years, give or take a few, and I have never, never, not once, not ever, ever, ever, ever, been to the Los Angeles Public Library. Not even when I was a kid. ,But I felt like one when I walked in. ,There's something uniquely LA to it. Could be the few crazy, yet inspirationally polite, homeless people wandering the halls meeting and greeting the odd assortment of hipsters, intellectuals, and recluses, whom in all fairness, are crazy in their own right for spending a Saturday afternoon in a public library, smack dab in the middle of the modern day frenzy that is multi-layered dimensional blurred social reality called Nowadays. Which I find very contemporary cosmopolitan. Which is very Los Angeles. ,And believe me. I know. After all, I've been alive for 100 years. Give or take a few. ,But when I walked in, I felt like a kid! ,This place was bigger than it looked outside! It was more colorful than the architecture indicated! It was more magic than the mundane sidewalks showed! ,We have castles in Los Angeles! Real life castles! Where wizards and warlocks scribed into tomes filled with secret magical incantations available for unlocking by simple unassuming adventurers just like me! ,There was a wing dedicated to original Sesame Street art. There was a room for adult literacy. There was a hallway that lead to the Mark Taper. There was the elevators wallpapered with Dewey Decimal catalog book cards. ,And, of course, books! ,We were only stopping by for the beginning of our Downtown LA adventure, but we ended up spending 100 more years at the Los Angeles Public library. ,Bring your dates. Unless they're stupid."
I have visited a lot of historical sites and this visit was by far my favorite.  The tour is short and simple without sacrificing substance or educational value. Get your tickets online before you go and follow the directions on the ticket to pick up your tickets before the scheduled time.  They will give them away.
"If you're in Seattle, you've got to do it!!! It's like going to New York City and going to see the Empire State Building, only this is like a fourth of the price!!! So you're winning either way. ,I should also mention that it is EXTREMELY cold and windy up there!! Stellar views."
"This is a good tour and is worth while.   There are also  other short tours of the senate building and the original Supreme Court.  Security moves quickly but does take  10-15 minutes depending on how many people with gas and backpacks.  You can walk all around the grounds.  We even got to go in early for our tour because the tour before us it wasn't full and we were nearby.  Later in the day are self guided tours, but the stories and history make the guided tour worth while.   Yes you can get tickets online for a fee or just show up at the desk.  Our tickets were for half hour later...enough time to walk over, go thru security and look around first."
I never get tired of visiting his iconic tourist attraction even though I am a Seattle native. Always so much fun to be up that high admiring the view anytime of the year. If you are thinking of catching a bite to eat the restaurant is pricey but the food is good!  They also will accommodate if you have special dietary needs which is very helpful to know.  Since the restaurant slowly rotates you always get an all around view of everything.
"When in Seattle you must go to the Space needle.,Of coarse it is a tourist trap, But you still need to go.,The views are amazing and you can sit and relax as long as you want and check out the view.,The whole main floor is a huge gift shop with every possible thing you could think of buying.,The one thing I really loved was the fudge they had, It is actually made in there restaurant.,The revolving restaurant is mic , But the prices are ridiculous, And you generally need reservations long in advance.,Definitely a must see when in Seattle."
Garbage gift shop. They have nothing of high quality and most of the stuff is from China. Makes the whole place look tacky. They need to hire some new buyers or something.
"It was cool and all, but when we wanted to leave it took 2 DAMN HOURS with a line of probably 40 people before us to leave the place. It seemed like the elevator wasn't functional with zero communication from the staff. I could have climbed the stair case 80 times in the time it took to leave the place. A bit ridiculous if you ask me. But on the other hand, they serve beer."
"Definitely worth the ride up if you have a city pass! If not I wouldn't bother, the view was nice but I spent a good 7 minutes until I got bored of people crowding, guess it's a tourist thing I had to do but wouldn't pay $20 just for one time!"
Great view.  Very crowded.  But not to be missed you're visiting Seattle.
"Up there with the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate Bridge, the Seattle Space Needle is more than a symbol of the city. It's one of those images that shouts ""America!"" Yep, it's not a free ride but it's a good one and on a clear day (good luck!), the view is amazing. Encompassing the downtown skyline, the harbor, Puget Sound and all the way to Mount Rainier, you can see all of the Seattle area at once.,Built for the World's Fair (when was the last time they had one of those) in 1962, it is 605 feet high and can withstand 9.1 magnitude earthquake. The observation deck is open to the public (it ain't free) and the elevators to get there take about 41 seconds. There is a staff person working the elevator. Those 41 seconds go pretty quickly, so you'll want to be ready with your clever question when they ask if you want to know anything.,As with such things, there's a huge gift shop in the base of the structure that sells everything from keychains to coffee mugs as well as art from local artists. Yep, it's corny but you should still go.,Completely open for handicap access, you'll want to ask the cashier for assistance. You get to skip to the head of the line so that you don't have to climb the outside ramp.,Once you're up at the top, there is a small coffee shop, some seating and the usual bathrooms. Because who doesn't want to pee when you're a tenth of a mile up in the air!"
"Read a BOOK! Read a BOOK!,Read a Muth*&@#fin BOOK!,r-e-a-d-a-b-o-O-KAAY,r-e-a-d-a-b-o-O-KAAY,Don't like reading? ,Come to this exquisite landmark anyway for their fantastic gift shop. Great stationary, jewelry, small toys, tote bags, candles, art and novelty books, and unique Los Angeles souvenirs. They also carry an awesome selection of hand puppets, including a praying mantis AND a big and plush tortoise with a metallic shell!!! Story time simply cannot get better than that."
"This is such a fantastic library. Everything is here. More than once I spent hours going through the social science wing reading every single title and taking out every other book (or, you know, a lot). ,The building itself is gorgeous. Although it looks large, the majority of the building is underground. For being subterranean, the entire library is incredibly light. Maybe I'm just seeing the light that radiates from me every time I step within its hallowed halls.  ,Everything you need is here. A ten-year-old Journal of Nature article on the Mitochondrial Eve or the newest best seller. Two different galleries offer interesting exhibits, usually having something to do with LA art. Movies, music, magazines and manuals. It's all within these walls. There is even a special wing specifically for adult literacy programs. ,My only real problem with the library is that every time I want to study or read I am distracted by multiple people snoring, loudly. It's a public library and I think it's great that people find refuge here. Still, if someone was humming or murmuring I expect a librarian to sush them, I see snoring as another noise disturbance that should be dealt with by the staff. It's just not fair for people who want to use the library to actually glean information for the books. ,I will miss the LAPL when I move to Portland. I just don't think the Multnomah County Library system will offer the same majesty that LA does. My standards are now very high."
"How can you not visit the Space Needle when in Seattle?! The Space Needle is the trademark of the Seattle Skyline so this was our first stop when we arrived. We visited on a Thursday afternoon and it was empty so we were able to get to the top within minutes of buying our tickets. The elevator ride up was fast and since the elevator is made up of glass, you see the landscape of the city as you go up. ,Once you reach the top, you get a good look at Seattle and beyond. Make sure to register you're name and where you are from on the touch screen wall, it will record your visit. There's also free pictures you can take by scanning your ticket. Once it's taken, you can post it to Facebook on the spot from one of many touch screen computers. ,When you go to the observation deck, you can walk around and get different views of the city. They offer a few telescopes so you can get a closer look of the sights. When we were there, it was cloudy and raining so we were not able to see Mt. Rainier in the distance but I was told that on clear days, you get that perfect picture! ,There's a café where you can enjoy a cup of Seattle's famous coffee as well as some quick snacks. The gift shop once you get back down is large and there's something for everyone. I found the prices to be very reasonable considering it's a tourist trap. I would suggest buying the Combo Tickets for the Space Needle and The Chihuly Garden And Glass Museum next door. The museum is well worth it even if you're not into that sort of thing, this one is made up of incredible works of glass that you will not run into everyday."
"the library is humungous and a beautiful building in downtown LA.  they have their own parking garage underground (entrance is on flower) and is only $1 with validation from the customer service desk on first floor.  ,there are so many sections and so many books on anything and everything one would ever need.  the only drawback is that there tends to be a lot of creepers bustling around so keep your eyes peeled for sketchy characters sneaking up on you.  ,free wifi, lots of places to study, helpful staff, self-service check out - it's amazing!"
"yes, 5 star review for a motor vehicle department? i cant believe it myself either.. probably it has more of to do with the reason why i was there, i was there merely to renew my car tag, not to change an out of state procedure or other complicated stuff. ,however, the car is registered under my husband who is out of town for 3 months and wont be back for another 2, and which unfortunately i dont even have a copy of his driving license as proof. ,knowing how all government official work, they are best at denying us the pleasure of a smooth visit each time. therefore, i went there today with the mental preparation that i was going to end up paying expensive parking downtown and coming home empty handed and mad.. ,However, i was proven wrong.when i entered the building, the security officers who sense that i was prob lost, immediately gave me direction to the new MVD suite. that was a good start.. when i entered the MVD, the customer service officer told me to proceed to cashier straight. so after merely 5 mins of being in there, i was already seated in front of a gentlemen behind glass window. he asked for my driver's license and asked for my car license plate number and my hunsband's name as a proof. and viola! i got my new sticker after 5 mins.!! and none of the ""pls fill up this form and go back to window 1 and wait for u name to be called"" kind of stuff.. i left the building a happy lady! ,to say the truth, the scariest part of all was the driving into downtown itself.. i got lost for like maybe 15 mins and spent another 10 min trying to find myself a parking spot and debating if i should be doing parallel... ,anyway, for those of you looking to renew your tag, dont worry! you are in good hands!"
"A mini oasis in downtown LA, the library is a great escape during one's lunch break. There's a little gift shop and fast food section (Panda Express and a deli) on the ground floor. There really isn't a bad place in the library to sit and read.  ,You should also check out the gardens that are on the west side of the building. There are a few statues and an artsy fountain. You can also have a nice sit down meal at Cafe Pinot, which is on the grounds of the library.,The great thing about the LA public library system is that it is sooo large. If there is some rare book you're looking for (in my case, a Finnish WWII book) that is in the system but not at that location, they will have it sent from the library that has it and the book will be waiting for you to pick up in a few days. Pretty nifty!"
"Something every tourist and local should do at least once. Great views, decent snack shop and plenty of seating to hang out rather than rush the experience."
"Got the city pass and got to go twice, once in the morning and once at night. Panoramic view of the city and complimentary photo? Yes, please! Once you are on top of the needle you can also enjoy hand made ice cream and dine at the restaurant. You can stay up there as long as you'd like and take all the photos you wish. It's kind of a tourist trap, but I didn't really mind. :)"
"Your portal maximum. ,Not just for information and books, but a portal to awkward moments, questionable smells, as well as accidentally watching someone watch porn before the library closes. Oh, and now that the city has cut back its hours, you're sure to appreciate its resources a little bit more."
"Well, the tuna tartare was fabulous, and service was swell in the summer of 1787, but their inability to keep my constitutional rights from being destroyed today is why I can only give them 3 stars"
"So here's the scoop... You can dine in and avoid paying the $26 per person to go up the the observation deck to take pictures. The food is overpriced but your paying for the view and it is an experience you should experience once while visiting Seattle. ,Elevator ride is very crowded and for any claustrophobic people this is not for you, only one elevator which is kind of a drag especially at peak hour when it's so busy!,You want to go at a time where you see everything during the day and watch the sunset, we went at 7:30 and it was perfect because we got to see at day and night. ,I made a reservation 2 months back and you can arrive 15 minutes prior to your reservation to take the elevator up to the observation deck. You check in with the front counter and they will give you a ticket after confirming your reservation which allows you to go up to the deck. We took some pictures and then they text me to let me know my table was ready. They were right on time with my reservation time when texting me.,Kristin our waitress was super sweet and checked in on us often to ensure we were doing okay. She delivered high quality customer service with a genuine smile on her face.,The view was spectacular and you cannot get this view with any other restaurant in Seattle. Food was tasty and the ice cream was definitely quality ice cream. ,Very expensive, but worth it once in your life!"
Was closed by the time we got there but we were able to get some great photos of the building.
"Our tour guide Chris was very passionate and excited for us.  This is no stuffy boring tour, this is the real deal.  To reserve tickets is free, but I arrived later in the day.  They were sold out, so I waited in line at the actual tour line for any openings.  Luckily I got in for the last tour of the day and it was awe inspiring.  A must see!"
"Hey Space Needle is one of the most prominent Seattle landmark - so how can you not visit here?,After having a memorable (even though my feet were weak and shaky) experience standing on top of the Taipei 101 (Taipei, Taiwan - 89th floor observation deck) and the Gateway Arch (Saint Louis, MO - 63 stories tall observation deck), Space Needle didn't seem so scary at all.,Space Needle, built in 1962 for the World's Fair, is approximately 60 stories tall.  Observation deck admission is $19 per adult and $34 for both observation deck + Chihuly Garden and Glass admissions). I was about 15 minutes late from my schedule launch time and one of the staff told me the admission ticket are still valid for the rest of the day.,Inside the observation deck, there were various educational panels about the Space Needle and a small cafe with tons of open seating. Outside the observation deck, you can take a 360 view of downtown Seattle, Mt. Rainier, and Puget Sound. Bring an extra jacket because it was really chilly and windy outside of the observation deck. ,You can also dine on top of the Space Needle (SkyCity at the Needle) - just know that it would be a pretty expensive meal.,The best way to get here is utilizing the Monorail. The Monorail connects the Seattle Center (where the Space Needle is located) directly to the downtown Seattle. Try to avoid taking the bus .... I took the bus to the Seattle Center and it was a pretty shady ride (hey I didn't know about the Monorail at the time). On the way back, I just took the Monorail and it was a much better experience.,As a tourist, you are probably only coming here once - so I would put the Space Needle on Seattle's do-to list and it is still worth a visit.,P.S. - Since I am a sucker on coin, I also bought a $4 souvenir coin."
"The Space Needle is better than the Empire State Building.  There, I said it.,Well, okay I should explain.  Or should I?  Maybe I should just leave it at that.  Drop the mic in New York's face.  You got outclassed by Seattle.,I'm getting too worked up over tall things.  Okay, bottom line: the view here is okay.  You're high up, can see the city, but at this point this isn't even the tallest observation desk around.  It's a nice view, though.  Really the only thing that gives the Space Needle a leg up on the ESB (Empire State Building...why did I abbreviate that and then immediately write it long form?) is the interior of the top floor is a nice little loung area with food and drinks and a few cool little interactive displays.,And while I'm here, can I just point out how ridiculous it is that both here and the ESB (maybe that pays off for earlier) you get your picture taken in front of a green screen before going up and then have a view of the city digitally put in behind you?  I mean, I sort of understand the logic, but it just speaks volumes about our world that we have a fake picture of the view taken right before going up and getting a real picture of the view.  It's like, when I go to the Grand Canyon, am I going to say ""You know, this picture is nice with me legitimately at the Grand Canyon...but couldn't I get a picture of me where the angle and perspective makes it so that I'm either a giant or hovering a hundred feet in the air near the Grand Canyon?  Can we just do that?"",Oh, and the fake pictures are sort of a wash.  You get the digital copies for free, which is nice.  But at the same time we almost didn't get ours because the server upload broke at some point so they had to do a manual upload after hours.,And there's a rotating restaurant up there (we didn't go, but I can only assume it would make me nauseous, regardless of speed."
"I'd like to say that the Space Needle was an awesome experience, but it wasn't for the simple fact that the line to get a ticket just doesn't move. A line of only thirty or so people manages to take about half an hour to go through, presumably because there's not an ""English isn't my native language"" line, when there needs to be one. With the City Pass, you're given two rides, so my girlfriend and I opted to go once midday and again at sunset.,Skipping the horrendous line situation, the line once you get inside is also a bit on the slow side. Then you're crammed into a tight elevator, and let out on the observation deck, which is also quite small, and flooded with people. The views from the top are really nice (if you're lucky enough to go up on a clear day), but I couldn't see myself spending the $20+ just for one visit on this. Fortunately for me, it was included in my City Pass.,The view from the top is great, but the inefficiency of the workers here and the more-expensive-than-it's-worth prices keep me from urging others to go up it."
My first time in Seattle so had to check it out of course. It gets a little crowded so I would suggest getting there earlier. It was a beautiful clear day so great time to see the whole city. Had fun taking some photos and seeing the city.
"If you're coming to Seattle for the first time, check out the Needle.  It's $36 for 2 adults to ride the elevator to the top if you go in the morning or evening, $48 if you go mid-day plus you get to pay for parking.  If you live here, you gotta go once, but then you'll be done.,The view of the city is pretty awesome, but the deck to walk around the top of the Needle is short-lived.  This is not like going to the top of the Sears Tower - the elevator ride is short and the view not as far since the Needle isn't super high."
"Space Needle- an iconic landmark in Seattle. ,It was $24 to go up. ,We came on a gloomy rainy day. The view was great like other high rise attractions, wish the weather was better. I'm sure the view would be spectacular on a clear day. ,There's a restaurant at the top but we didn't eat there. We did grab some wine at the cafe. ,If you show one of the employees your ticket you can get a free photo op. that is later emailed to you."
"*ATTENTION* - THIS REVIEW IS REGARDING THE ETHOSTREAM WIFI SERVICE ONLY - ONLY - ONLY,It stinks! Lol. Seriously, I've been to the marvelous downtown Central Library on numerous occasions and have always had horrible connectivity problems with Ethostreams sappy wireless.,I'm not the only one. I sit and watch everyone else with a blink screen on their laptops waiting for that flicker of light indicating a transfer of a few bytes.  Phooey I say!!!!,What's worse is that since the library contracts this service out to Ethostream, they do not have an onsite IT person to help with anything. You must contact Ethostream directly using an 800 number - which, of course, you have to do away from your laptop because no cellphones are permitted in the library . . . . Phooey I say!!!!,Right now I'm writing this review at the library and there is no guarantee that I'll be able to post it before I have to leave shortly.,Yes, I have contacted Ethostream's customer service and although the woman I spoke to was polite and helpful-sounding, I was faced with the decision to reset the service . . . must wait half-an-hour for results. After waiting half-an-hour the service was back on and I was able to connect to the Internet, but where's the consistency of connection? There isn't any consistent connection that I can tell - one always gets disconnected, stuck, or frozen . . . . Phooey I say!!!!,Now, you may be asking, what type of computer are you using? Maybe your laptop is a piece of $#!+ that was defunct to begin with. Well, no, my friend, I am using a state-of the-art HP with built in WiFi that has accelerated and enhanced connectivity services. Basically it's a kick-azz machine that is designed for connectivity: WiFi, Bluetooth, Fast Infrared, and a GSM Broadband Modem!!!!,It's not me!!!!!!!!!!!!!,So, Phooey I say!!!!! Get a better service!,Other than that I love the library (except the cafe that has outrageous pricing)  xo"
"Awesome awesome awesome public library.  It is a lot larger than it looks from the outside.  I highly recommend doing the self-tour that you can download from the website (,).  My favorite parts were the Children's Lit Dept and the chandeliers in the Tom Bradley Wing.  There are even art galleries! The Childrens area is so adorable - everything is miniaturized and they have a little theatre for puppet shows and story time.  The Teen'scape would be a cool place to hang out if I was younger.  ,I don't think I'd trek out here on a weekday when parking is pricey, but on the weekends, it's only $1 during library hours (10-6) with validation!!! All you need is a library card, which you can get on the spot or pre-register for one online and pick it up at any public library."
"I bought one of the city passes, which included day/night passes up the space needle. The view from the top of the space needle is breathtaking. It's definitely one of the structures you need to see for yourself."
My favorite library in L.A.
"This library is AMAZING!  It is quite grandeur and full of history. You could stay in  this place for a week and still not experience all of it. They have books here that you would not find directly at the smaller branches (w/o having to order it).  There are some amazing eateries..and awesome exhibits...right in this place..a vast Children's section, and so on and so forth."
"I'm probably the only person on this page who thinks the service offered at the MVD is alright. To be fair, my circumstances were in no way ""special."" I just had a straight renewal and had put off registering online because, quite frankly, I was worried that good ole Mr. Tan (my cranky '98 Chevy Malibu) would fail emissions, as he has in the past. Anyway, I was in and out in under 5 minutes, and I got to pay a dollar less because I ""walked"" in my payment. Plus, I got the cardio of the mile-and-a-half round-trip walk from my office to the MVD, which made me feel better about mowing down on that Gyro at Heavenly Cafe 10 minutes later. The two ladies who assisted me were courteous and friendly and there was plenty of signage pointing me to the new suite (2097, formerly 1106) that the MVD occupies. From reading all the other reviews on this page, I can only assume that things are more difficult when you are moving from another state. That's Georgia for you; good luck and godspeed!"
"What an amazing library, this place is huge! And the gardens are also a very welcome sight in Downtown LA.,They have vast collections for the bookworm in all of us.,I only wish the parking structure had better signs and directions. It was confusing at first trying to get around the area.,I always say we could use more gardens and libraries in the world."
"After trekking to the base of Mt. Rainier the day before, I knew it wouldn't be worth $20 to ride to the top of the Space Needle just to see the same thing farther away.  I also got a great shot of downtown including the Space Needle at Kerry Park, so just seeing the Space Needle up close was enough for me.,Being the photo buff that I am, I took quite a few shots around the base of the Needle looking up and back about 20 feet to get a few of the art installations in the shot as well.  I could have stayed there all day taking pictures because the whole area is pretty neat.  There's a cool gift shop inside and they had a lot of stuff with the Needle on it and your usual Seattle memorabilia.  The restrooms inside were surprisingly clean.  The area inside gets a bit crowded depending on the day you're there due to those buying tickets to ride up to the top.  I guess they also have a restaurant at the top as well which would be cool.  If you're gonna pay the ticket price, might as well eat the restaurant and see it for the price of your meal anyways.  ,I will say the area outside of the Needle is a bit sketch.  I wouldn't walk along at night if ya know what I mean. All in all, pretty neat!"
"check out the architecture...then check out a book.  The part I always forget is to read it.  ,I travel a lot and their travel book selection is current and has lots of variety.  Saves me lots of $$$."
Visited during September and February.  Apparently you don't need tickets during both January and February.  The tours by the parks department are informative and the rangers are friendly.  If you love history you won't want to miss this.
"Visiting independence hall in Philly is a must. It's a nice building in a, beautiful and historic location. There is a brief security check, than ,you can enter the different buildings on the site. The main building can, only be entered with a tour group that starts only at certain times ,(multiple per hour), but lasts 45 min."
Rich with history! Worth the wait. I actually got teary eyes when I walked in. Amazing to think our forefathers set laws we still abide by in place in that very room.
"I went on July 8th and it was pretty cool that some of the coworkers dressed up in costume and read the Declaration of Independence aloud. They encouraged the crowd to cheer or jeer, pretend we're British or American.,I got a ticket ahead of time by making reservations on line, but come the day of, I was able to switch to an earlier slot in the day without issues.,The only time I had to wait was the liberty bell, the line snaked around the building. Once inside, we were free to roam around without being rushed.,I say if you're going to be in they city, it is worth checking out to see where Declaration was signed."
"When I came here I bought the Seattle City Pass which provides day and night access.  ,Upon entering you are debriefed on the history of the Space Needle.  Once you arrive at the elevator you are given a quick minute history of the elevator (and man do they time that perfectly).  Upon entering the Space Needle you get an excellent view of Emerald City."
"If you eat at the restaurant, a trip to the top is included.,Take the monorail here to add to the experience.  Stop by the EMP museum while you are here also.,The views are good.  You can see everything.  The have computer screens that you can interact with to get more details.  There is a small food place inside to get a snack.,So, a fun day combining it with lunch at the restaurant, the EMP museum and walking the gardens"
What a great way to see all of Seattle from about 500 ft up!  Walk around the whole deck to see everything Seattle has to offer and make sure to take your camera.  Don't forget to add your name and location to their digital list and be apart of history.
You will see the entire city from a 360 degree. And you could entertain yourself with the program there. Perfect historic attraction for sightseeing.
"This may seem like a cool tourist attraction and fun place to go with the family/friends, but I would recommend a few other places before you go here. Of course there's nothing wrong with visiting the famous space needle but if you want to get to the top don't mind blowing a few bills to get a ""ok"" view. Before you purchase a ticket also think about just eating at the restaurant instead. Its a $35 minimum which is about two appetizers and a few drinks and then after you can go straight up to the observatory. Best view of Seattle, by far, is also the Sky View Observatory in case you are wondering."
A little spendy to just go up to the top- but none the less a great view of the city and there was very little wait when we went up.
"Absolutely breathtaking. I strongly recommend visiting early in the morning like I did. No lines, no wait times, no crowds, and you even get the ""early bird"" ticket price (save $5)! Take the monorail- super fun, fast and inexpensive. I'm a solo traveler for business and I had a fantastic time."
"The library is as good, or better, than many university libraries. Its vastness is a bit intimidating until you get used to it. It is logically arranged, and books are easily found. The database works perfectly, and is open-ended: you can punch in the title, author, or subject and find a book. ,One caveat: you will get a receipt for checking out books. GET A RECEIPT for bringing them back, and don't use the bins on the street. I am out $7.50 because two books I know I returned did not arrive at the right location for ten days.  Four other books brought back at the same time were processed correctly: it makes no sense at all. If you don't have a receipt, they won't even  discuss an error they made."
"I give this library high praise for still providing an invaluable service to the community. Free access to millions of books, videos, audio and art. When the path out of ignorance and poverty seems lost in the night of despair, this place is like a beacon of hope. Don't get emotional when you see the statue of liberty, fall to your knees when you see this library."
"I was pleasantly surprised by how much we actually enjoyed our visit to the space needle.  We got there just as they opened and the ticket to elevator trip was quick.  On a reasonably clear day, the views were very nice, but what really made the trip fun for the kids were all of the interactive tools at the top. The binoculars didn't work well but there were lots of other ports for zooming in and seeing city landmarks and just better views of items on the horizon.,We opted for the Citypass and are happy we did. Pricey at $187 for 2 adults and 1 child, but kids under 3 were free! Win for us."
"I want to give this place 5 stars, because it's beautiful and huge and beats out even the NYC libraries I used to go to when I lived there. There are millions of books and even a book shop, food court, events and classes. That said, I now rarely go for more than a few minutes, even though I work nearby. The place smells like a locker room, because they allow homeless folks to camp out there and shower in the bathrooms (honestly, the bathrooms are borderline health hazard). The stacks smell like armpits, moisture and feet. I often hold my nose if I have to browse and I'm not that sensitive. There seems to be no enforcement either. Listen, I sympathize with the plight of the homeless, especially in this economy, and have no problem with them hanging out (especially with a book or computer), but they are a 10-20 minute walk from some of the biggest homeless shelters on the West Coast. There's no reason they can't find a shower and laundry there and then come over. There's no reason security can't remind them of that. The situation has ruined the library experience for me and encouraged me to treat it like I do a shoe store (know what I want, find it, check it out, buy it, get out in under 30 minutes) or take myself elsewhere."
"An amazing beautiful library, clean and modern, with a wonderful garden.  Inside it's a place you could get lost (in fact it looks much bigger once you're inside than it ever does from the outside).  Very easy to navigate and the staff here are helpful."
Really cool! Ate at the restaurant too. Definitely worth the trip.
"I've been coming here for over 10 years! My mom forced me to go to the library everyday during my summer break for at least 4 hours. So this was basically my playground as a child. As I aged, the different floors and sections also aged with me. I started out in the childrens section, moved up to the teen section, and now to the adult section. ,The interior of this building is beautiful and spacious. There's computers in every room for patrons to use. Bathrooms on every floor. But also beware that this library is full of downtown la's hobos. They'll linger on each floor, tables, chairs, and bathrooms. So be careful when you take a seat. ,What I also love the most? Their wide book collection. They have almost every single book possible. When I was in college, I used to find some of my school books and saved some money. Their 3 weeks of checkout and renewal service is also awesome. They also have great selection of audio books on tape, CD's, and DVD's.,Now tell me, what library has their own Panda Express and TCBY? I used to get $5 for lunch and it fit the bill, if not, there's unlimited possibilities within a 3 block radius.,Parking is not free but they do have an undergroud parking garage on Flower St. They'll validate on the weekdays and weekends and it'll run you for about $1 per hour. Always remember to have your library card. Get validation at the front office near the check out stands."
Fun tour and such an important historical site. The tour guide was really nice and pretty knowledgable. I ask him about his favorite signer of the constituion: James Madison.
"This is my favorite museum/historical building in Philly. It not only offers a wealth of information from wonderful tour guides but you literally are in the rooms where all of the country's first documents were signed. Such an amazing experience. You can also go to the top floor, which I suggest doing, and see some artifacts from that time period and there is also a map showing the country's boundaries and territories that were involved at that time, which I thought was really cool. This is one of the best pieces of history that has been maintained in the city and if you go anywhere I suggest you go here."
"It was okay. I may be biased, but I feel like any mall, especially one called Independence Mall should at least have a Talbot's. I mean come on!"
"If you are in Seattle I guess this is a rite for passage for any tourists. But is it worth it?  $22 to go up to the needle and look around. I don't know you decide?  On a clear day maybe?  The views are better. On a normal Seattle day maybe not.  There is not much to do once you are up there, look around with a few of their viewing interactive computers, take some pics, maybe grab a bite to eat and talk. That's about it. Worth $22? I'm not so sure!"
"The view from the top of the needle was breathtaking. I love all the 60s themed decor. The 360 degree view is so cool. We went on a pretty clear day when it opened at 9:30, and we had no line or wait. I loved being able to take a picture and then download it and email it to myself. Overall a great experience but go early!"
"I came here, bought tickets for the next possible time (45 minutes away), and then got in line.  Then I realized my phone was still set to Mountain time and realized I had to wait an hour and 45 minutes, with a fast setting sun, no jacket, and a mile walk back to the car.,So I decided to wait it out.  Now what do you possibly do at the Space Needle for 2 hours on a Sunday?  Not much.  You wander around the gift shop, looking at every little thing in excruciating detail.  You read every little bit of text you can find, all the small signs, computer screens, souvenir boxes, and more.  I've got to admit that it was pretty brutal.,Eventually I got bored and went back outside to wait in line.  Of course I was the first for my group.  The line was pretty crowded though with the several outings before mine, all sold out.  I read books on my phone, did some yelping, did some reading for the next leg of my North-West disc golf tour, and eventually it was finally time for me to go up.,At the top I was happy to see a Starbucks greeting me on the other side of the elevator door.  I bought a nice, warm drink and made my way to the outer walkway, noticing the no food/drink sign on the way out the door.  I began walking around in the cold, with no jacket, using my drink as a heating device.  I tried to keep it hidden, but eventually I was found out and had to return inside to finish it off.  Once done with my drink I circled around a few times, used the awesome binocular things a couple of times, and overall had a good time.,When I was ready to go down I got on the elevator and headed down.  The gift shop was still open, so I got a drink of water and began the journey to my car.,Overall it was a good experience and the only negatives were my own fault.  Definitely worth the $20 for a first time Seattle visit, though I'm not sure I'd go back unless it was with someone else who hadn't gone."
"The space needle is one of the most iconic places you can go to in Seattle. ,It's pretty pricey for $19.00 a ticket of $29.00 for both day and night trip but I had the pleasure of eating at the Sky City Restaurant which gives you a free ticket to the observation deck.,Coming at the end of March you really take a chance on the weather. Luckily the day that we came the sky was clear without any clouds! We were even able to see Mount Rainier which I heard is very rare to see especially in the winter/ spring time. ,Come back again? For sure but I would highly recommend eating at the Sky City Restaurant instead of buying tickets"
"Get a library card.  After that a visit to the downtown central library is not to be missed.  Few in Los Angeles realize that the LAPL is one of the largest and  well-stocked libraries in the world and that the central branch is bristling with art and architecture that is well worth a trip downtown.,Weekend parking under the library is only $1.00 although only between certain hours. ,I have long been a fan of the central library with the first lure being the fascinating Egyptian style used by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue.  [Some of Goodhue's Egyptian bungalows can be seen in Atwater Village as well].  Massive bronze and ebony statues depicting sphynxes, snakes, swords and other Gothic-Egyptian motifs abound.  See the LAPL website and Wikipedia for more on the history of this fabulous building [and photos].,While I was a critic of the massive remodel, it was done very well.  The library has been expanded hugely and updated with almost 100 free computer terminals, hundreds of private one-person study tables and well stuffed chairs.,Being an avid cook I can highly recommend the extensive cookbook collection  in the Science and Technology department and the well stocked DVD rental section just off the first floor.,I'd skip the Panda Express and new cafes that were added during the remodel.  Instead walk across the street to the historical Biltmore Hotel on Grand Avenue and have tea in the Rendevous Court or stronger libations in the lovely Gallery Bar and Cognac Room."
"One of the few things I admire and frequent in downtown. It's free, and a great way to cool down, spending a couple of hours skimming through its extensive collection.,Wander through the central/great atrium and the old lobby ( where the Teen and the Children's sections are - where  I usually spend most of my time, not because my brain is that of a 7-year old, asshole, it's because I enjoy children's illustrated books: refer to review of ""Every Picture Tells A Story"") and enjoy the great architectural details.,Although a few homeless people have taken refuge here from the heat and the noise of Skid Row, still, it's a great place to visit.  Stay at the glass bridgeway connecting to the ""Fiction/Popular Circulation"" on the 4th floor and sit on one of the SoHo chairs facing the grand atrium. You not only look, but actually feel scholarly.  ,And I've heard a few stories about the men's restroom in the 4th floor, or is it the 3rd floor? But I think they're just urban legend. And if you're too broke to rent videos at Blockbuster, you can get a number of good titles here too.,If you have not been here and you're a native Angeleno, just go already, books don't bite, you know?  And if you guys get bored with books, head over  to The Standard next door..."
"Visited Seattle for the first time and was told this was a must see, and they were correct! The view is amazing and hard to beat, and the price isn't bad at all! We went ahead and tried the SkyCity Restaurant as well. The salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted so fresh! Definitely the best sea food I have ever had. I would highly recommend stopping by while in this beautiful city!!"
by far the best library i've been in. but i don't go to a lot of them. haven't been here since my senior year of college...about 4 years ago. i was forced to go because of my senior thesis. lots of art history and architecture books! but i had to go around the block three times to find the parking structure. a must see los angeles landmark.
"I love the library! As a grad student in LA, it is has been and invaluable resource. They don't have everything for obscure research projects but they have a lot. Everybody should you use the library.,My only complaints are that the CD section is a mess and that they changed the checkout from three weeks to only two recently. Those don't even knock the stars on my review because the library is so good."
There is a freaking Panda Express in the library! WTF???
"This is something you have to go to, to pay homage and respect for the founding of this country. This is where America started and as you go in you can feel the history. You can see where the continental congress met and where George Washington sat to oversee the signing of deceleration of Independence."
"Be sure to go to the visitor center first (in front of the Liberty Bell building) to get your timed ticket. I wish the tour had been longer and we'd had more time to ask questions, but the guide was very informative and engaging with the little time we had. This is definitely a worthy thing to do when you're in Philly. Do it in the morning, first thing, and spend the rest of the morning at the other historic sites. They're all very close together and they flow pretty well, too."
Super cool! you have to at least come and visit it once in your life. It was great.
"Do not hesitate to buy your tickets online ahead of time.  Doing so allows you to go straight to check-in gate and avoid long lines.  As expected, the area surrounding the entrances and exits are bustling with people, so you'll need a little bit of patience when looking for that check-in line.  We didn't wait too long before boarding the elevators for a quick ride to the top.,The views are amazing.  We were lucky to be here on a sunny day with clear, blue skies.  Even though there were a lot of people here, we were able to edge up to the railings to admire the view and take photos.  There are markers on each side noting the direction you're facing - each direction has a unique view, so you really should circle the entire Space Needle - and do so more than once!,You can spend as much time as you want up there.  There is an observation deck inside too, but the views are much better outside.,Ticket prices varies on the time of day, so budget travelers or early risers will appreciate this.  I usually avoid pricey attractions in lieu of finding an equal, if not better view, elsewhere, but visiting the Space Needle was definitely worth it.  If I had to do my trip all over again, I would do it exactly the same way:  book online, go mid-day, walk round and round the observation decks a few times.,The elevator ride down opens to a gift shop, of course.  Skip this and get your souvenirs elsewhere."
"Ah! The whole reason I came to seattle. Had to do a research project on anxiety and facing/overcoming fears.  I chose this place because I can relate to the fear of heights. It was such a fun experience nonetheless. Though the space needle was crowded,  we had tickets at will call and were able to get up to the top in about 20 mins. Other people waited for a couple hours. The staff was great,  answered all the questions I had for them. I learned a lot and enjoyed myself! Next time I just want to go and not be preparing for a project.  Love the amazing views!"
"The Space Needle is just a Seattle bucket list item. I probably won't do it again. I got tired of the view. I'm sure on the perfect day, the sunset is gorgeous so here's hope that you go on that day. Purchase your ticket online and you get a few bucks off if I remember correctly."
"I absolutely adore this place! It's such a remarkable view of the city. I'm constantly amazed by the features here. I loved the giftshop, the glass elevator to the top, the crazy-busy espresso stand and finally the breath-taking 360 view of my city. I will continue to play tourist here and one day soon I hope to be reviewing the revolving restaurant located here as well. Soon enough!"
"books! yaaaawwwn.....but the international languages section is the bomb!!!! i've been checkin out free language stuff there for when i travel. i highly highly recommend pimsleur. ,ur tax dollars at work! i luv socialism!"
"I love libraries; that certain, somewhat musty smell of books, the feeling of complete isolation mixed with a sense of commonality with everyone else in the building, the total silence that isn't scary so much as reassuring... But in this case, the library takes second place to the truly great part of this place: the garden area outside. Best grassy knoll in downtown for those fall afternoons where you have nothing to do but eat the farmer's market apple you just bought, read the book you can't put down, and relax on the grass in the sun."
"Considering im terrified of heights and that i was actually brave enough to shoot up the little elevator that goes to the top, this was a pretty koo experience.  ,It felt like i was walking sideways like the floor was tilted. After a few deep breathes and a few self motivation pep talks i did alright and enjoyed it after a while. Going up was terrifying going down was worst but at the same time relieving because i was back down on the ground. I recommend you buy the combo pack for the space needle and the museum tour i think it was worth the money payed. ,Before going up the elevator they take a complimentary photo which u could get thru an email. When ur on top they also take a pic. Both pictures are complimentary and since u payed the money might as well take advantage and do it.,Reason im deducting a star is because once ur on top and if u want to buy a drink or wine u have to go to the downstairs restaurant which u have to take the elevator again and get ur drink, i think that was dumb cuz i couldnt get a drink to calm my nerves."
"carrie bradshaw stole my idea of getting married in a library!!,this library ooozes dope-ness!,im here at least once a week..,theres a stack of books on my dresser that need to be returned!,out of all the libraries, the ""hold"" system here is the best!!,i've been waiting MONTHS for a certain book, and all the other libraries' ""hold"" system is non existant! ,but here, you get an email notification, and you get over a week to pick your book up!!,so everytime you check to see if your local library has that copy (you're too cheap to buy or ebays price is too close to the actual book price you'll find at Borders) and it says ""in transit"" well, {enter evil wicked witch of the west laugh & cackle here} that means someone has that book on ""hold"",and 9 days is plenty of time to get your ass to that library!,yes, this library is a homeless shelter.. ,you'd be here too if your carton studio on wall st & 9th didnt have central a.c so leave them alone!,yes, the elevator has a funky stench but the old skkool dewey decimal index cards wallpaper on the elevator car's walls are dope ass art work!,the bathrooms are ALWAYS SPARKLING clean which means one thing only: the staff here is on it! (considering the traffic of people who bathe here.. i heard a woman bathing in the handicap stall once, cuz its got its own sink),there is so much privacy room here, if you cant finish your summer school english 101 term paper here, well, youre an idiot!,this library has a dope ass collection of antiques magazine that you will NOT find at barnes & noble or borders!,there are 2 red line stops nearby so parking should be a non issue..,there are self check out kiosks so you dont have to mess w/the fat rude staff at the checkout section..,theres a miniature food court as well...,there are so many benches outside, to the south & west of the library..,you can truly spend HOURS here if youre a geek-a-zoid (which i am..  you can find me in the 365 aisle of the social science floor !!"
"Oh Central Library.. because of you I no longer buy books. You always have everything I want, especially theatre works, and you're even up to date with the latest editions! We're going to be seeing each other often =)"
"HUGE library that is worth checking out, even if you aren't looking for a book.  The layout is a little confusing, but there are some very impressive murals and original design elements around every corner.  There's also the Getty Gallery, which has free exhibits and a store off the lobby with a very cool selection of LA-related books, stationery, cards and other items.  BTW, if you read this before March 29, 2009, be sure to check out the impressive exhibit of maps they've got going on.  There are tons of old LA maps that the nerd in you will love.,--,A short walk from the Pershing Square Red Line Station."
Absolutely fabulous! If only the walls could talk. Park Ranger guides know their history and do a superb job of marshaling the crowds and providing an informative tour.
"So big that there are separate floors dedicated to different genres. Also, make sure to check out the library's bookstore! I found some great titles in excellent condition, including a UK version of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" for only five dollars."
"To be in the same place where the Declaration of Independence and the constituion were signed is MIND BLOWING and deserves 5 stars!,They even have the exact chair that George Washington sat! A lot of history in this building and who wouldn't want to see the spot where are country originated from."
"Night time when we were up there. Pretty cool, we could watch the soccer game. View was amazing. We ate there in the restaurant, I suggest you do that 200%. Such o good time."
"I had a great time taking my mom to see all the sites in Seattle. Living here we often forget how fun it can be to be a tourist. I got a City Pass, and if you are going to the Space Needle the City Pass is the way to go. It lets you go into the Space Needle twice. I really liked that the Space Needle offers you free pictures that you can email to yourself. We went up at night and it was windy and rainy but we had a lot of fun. We had a few drinks at the bar. Took a rainy windy tour around it. The next day it was beautiful and sunny. We got to see the city again and enjoy the Museums around the needle."
"GET THE SEATTLE CITY PASS. $69 for a bunch of cool attractions, including this one.,The space needle is just one of those touristy things to do. It's worth it with the City Pass, but I wouldn't recommend buying a ticket full price. It's just like any other super tall building where you need to buy a ticket to access the top floor. You get a nice view of the city, but the bars/gates around the top area blocks a full view. The food atop is overpriced as expected. Look for the spiders that you could see in one of the photos! It's a cool view."
"The space needle is an icon of Seattle and whole of Pacific Northwest and there was no way I was not going to visit it.  We went on a day where it was in the 90's and the skies were as clear as they can be! I recommend purchasing tickets for both the Chihuly Garden and the observation deck ($44) as you will save $5 total. A lot of people had city passes and I were there longer I would have done that as well. ,THE CON: What took away the experience for was the lack of organization starting all the way from the ticket counters to getting up and back down from the observation deck. There is A LOT of waiting (a line to buy tickets, a line to get up to the elevators, a line for the actual elevators and a line to get back down). The elevator itself was neat and it went 10 miles per hour (4.5 m/s) and the whole trip took 41 seconds. ,Views on some sides were more impressive than others. I recommend going very early in the morning to avoid the crowds or at night. I like that they had day/night passes as well. In addition, they had times of the day where it was cheaper. ,I don't meant to be negative nelly here but the space needle was impressive of course since there is a lot of history and it is a must to visit but it's just a one time thing. I would not visit it again."
"The jaw-dropping beauty of the library's art deco design would be enough to draw me in on a regular basis, but add to that the amazing special exhibits and free ALOUD lecture series and you've created nirvana for a nerd like me. And did I mention that I don't have to drive there? It's right between two metro stations."
"So I went to the library to catch the exhibit of Day Of The Dead style contemporary art. The Getty Gallery, located in the library, is currently one of my favorite places to see art in the city. I hope to see some more shows there. It's truly a gallery that identifies with the city itself. The curator really takes consideration of local people's interests. So do make it a point, as a proud Angeleno, to go there and just beam.,There's just something about the smell of old books that makes me wax nostalgic for my youth. When I was growing up, we didn't have the fancy ass interweb. I had to read for pleasure- not just for studying. I still try to withhold that tradition but with technology running rampant everywhere it's really hard to take time off to read. You know, I plan to take at least one day out of my month to just come here and grab a few books. I can sacrifice one trip to the mall, market, record store, etc. ,Wait a second- they have an AWESOME store there! It's like the gift store at MOCA but without the lines and the snooty people. I got most of my Christmas shopping done here last year and it was a breeze- from cards all the way to gifts. Best part- no lines! Hooray. So what if they don't carry the Commes Des Garcons fragrance line. Your friends don't deserve it anyways. Come here and buy them something really unique. ,Parking sucks- it's downtown so it comes with the territory."
"I know, I know. How can I give this place a 3 star? It's a tourist must see, But it was really boring to me. I don't regret checking out the Space Needle because that's something you gotta do when you're in Seattle. We had to take an elevator that took us to the top of the Space Needle, when we got to the top we headed straight outside to see the view for about 5 minutes just to take some selfies, after that we were bored. ,My friend and I went back inside and had a nice chat with the bartender then we both decided to get a glass of wine. The bartender was super fun and we just had a good time gossiping about random stuff and that helped us waste about 20 minutes. ,The view was fine after 10 minutes, we didn't stay more than an hour and decided it was time to go. It cost us $36 to see the Space Needle and Chihuly Glass museum together which save us about $8 when we bought the combo. If we bought the ticket separately, it would have cost us $22 each which makes it $44 for both. I actually enjoy the Chihuly Glass museum more than the Space Needle but that's another review. ,Would I recommend anyone to go to the Space Needle? Yes, because it's a tourist spot. Kind of like going to the Great Wall, when you're in China. Of course you gotta go see their tourist spots, but I would tell them not to expect much. You're just really high up looking down on buildings. Would I come back? Sure, if I'm back in Seattle with people who never been. But other wise? I wouldn't be super excited to come back. ,To me, this place was okay, I'll come back with friends or family who never been. Other than that, No, Thank you."
i can't imagine what it would be like to come here as a child.  this is no dinky petit branch library in syracuse new york (although i do appreciate the effort mom).   this temple of books makes it almost seem like our city finds literacy important.  the lectures here are  great.  they have this whole area devoted to helping people learn to read.  it's a wonderland.
"Wow I've dreamed of going to Central and it was as great as I expected. As a person who likes to browse for interesting books this place is almost like a huge trap for me,every section had something I would find myself reading and checking out. ,The audio visual section makes me think more of a video store or rental store than even a library. I also really liked the art and features that reminded me of a museum. For studying I liked seeing all the study sections.  This will have to be my second favorite library (and the first is my favorite more for it's childhood memories than it's collection)"
"we got advanced tickets for this.  The small booking fee locks in a time.  Worth doing if you are sure you are going to be there at a given time.  The day of, it is a crap shoot and you are unlikely to get in without tickets.  The guy we had from the NPS was eloquent in speaking and knew the ins and outs of the buildings.  You get a short film and if it is painfully hot (it was the day we were there), it is a nice break.  A cool part of history where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed."
"If I could only use one library for the rest of my life, I would choose LA Public Library without a moment's hesitation.,You can spend the entire day at the LA Public Library. Trust me, I've done it... and more than once. In the college years I regularly took the train here on the weekends. Yes, this library is so amazing that I took a train for an hour for the sole purpose of going to a library. Or maybe I was just geeky. I suspect it was a bit of both.,Unlike most libraries, I was never able to get an iota of studying done. I was too enchanted by the fabulous architecture, the hidden nooks and crannies, and the seemingly endless supply of books throughout its seven floors. I don't believe I ever checked out books from the LA Public Library, but I read a few of their enormous supply while there. Quite happily, I believe these library outings helped contribute to my intellectual development while studying near LA."
"Always one of our favorite stops in Philly.  Get your tickets early, it's free, but you have to go to the Visitor Center and get time-stamped tickets for an entry time later that same day.  ,Admission is very well managed.  Just show up about 30 minutes before your entry time, go through security, then wait till your time is called.  The tour guides are knowledgeable and interesting.  It's amazing to think about what went on in this building.  ,There's only one original piece of furniture in the space but the period furniture filling in for the original pieces are interesting and give you a sense of how it might have been furnished originally.  ,While you are in the building, take a moment to notice the ceiling, the moldings, and the doors.  Also notice the interior colors.  During the restoration, great care was taken to determine what colors were on the walls during the period of time that the Constitution was signed and the space was returned to those hues.  Just amazing."
"Iconic landmark of Seattle- must go up at least once when visiting!,Tickets are $18 online/$21 at the door and you can also get combo tickets with Chihuly Gardens (recommended).,I went on a Saturday afternoon in March (slow season) and it wasn't too packed. One of the elevators was closed so there's a bit of wait to go back down but it's not bad. The door to go outdoors is a regular door. You'd imagine a bigger door so the crowds dont have to wait for each other when going in/out.,I was pretty impressed by the technology. They give you a ticket with a barcode you can scan at the selfie camera hanging outdoors. Then you scan it in a touchscreen machine inside and you can email it to yourself or share in social media. This is pretty cool and free and much better than taking a selfie with your smartphone.,They also have othet big touch-screen displays that tell you about the construction, a digital guestbook that shows how far you've traveled to be there, a description of landmarks and places of interest surrounding you, etc etc,You can also grab a beer and snacks while up there.,Don't miss it!,Yelp 100 Challenge! 2015: 37/100"
"Though it is a tad expensive, I definitely thought it was worth getting a ticket here, especially for the price of the combo package with Chihuly Gardens. The staff was funny and friendly, the elevator ride was exhilarating, and the view from the top was truly stunning. It was such a joy to be able to walk around and get a 360 view of Seattle."
"Tourist trap but a tourist must! Definitely dine at Sky City. I think the view there is superior. The observation deck kind of had a barb wire, and I could hardly get a nice photo. $19/26 PP is steep for just admission, save that and eat at SkyCity and you get free admission to the observation deck! ,I love these glass elevators, although these ones went up faster than I would have liked. The gift store is plentiful but as expected, overpriced. There's plenty of interactive media that teaches you about Seattle. You can circle the indoor and outdoor observation deck. It was raining when I went, and I wish there was a cover outdoor, which would have been very helpful, and you'd think they would have it for a rainy city like Seattle!,The space needle is photogenic, I wish I got to take more photos of it,***,Tip: eat at restaurant, and you pay a bit more and you get a meal!,Favourites: Nice view, elevator ride!,Do not want: barbed wire. No covers. Elevator ride was too fast! and a 10-15 minute wait.,Last words: Something to do at Seattle ;)"
"This is a very pretty library, but functionally it's a disaster. It's virtually impossible to find a specific item without asking for help (and I'm a librarian!). On the bright side, the people are helpful when you ask.,There is a significant shortage of directional signage in the building and books are scattered in various departments, some upstairs, some downstairs. If you're new here, you'd have no way of knowing that it's not enough to have a call number -- you need the call number AND the department name.,My most recent visit is unfortunately typical. I came in with the call number and department of the book I wanted in hand.  But where was the Arts and Recreation Department? I found a sign that said it was upstairs, so I headed up the escalator.,There didn't seem to be anything on the first floor I arrived at, so I continued up.  Wrong! I had to go back to the apparently empty floor.  No sign pointed to the Arts and Recreation Department so I went the wrong way before turning back and finding it.,Once in the department, there were no large call number signs (e.g. ""800-820 to the right; 821-840 to the left"") to help locate the right shelf. This is typical for all the departments. I was looking for 796.1, so I worked my way through the department, finally reaching the last aisle -- which had 795, but not 796.  ,After circling the stacks twice, I gave up and asked a librarian where 796.1 was. ""The Sports Room,"" he said. Which was at the other end of the department. Sigh.,Finally, I located my book and took it downstairs to check out. Nope, said the clerk, this is a reference book, you can't check it out. How could you tell?  It didn't say ""reference"" or ""not for checkout"" or anything like that. It wasn't on the reference shelf. The only clue that it was reference book was an ""R"" over the call number."
"One of the best libraries in Los Angeles.  And I still come here in order to keep up to date.  It is well organized and it is clean!  This place is a book worm's dream!  I've picked up plenty of useful material, while I was in college.  Parking around the vicinity is sky high!  As a result, I bike here.  Don't ever leave your laptop or other personal effects alone!  Pack it up and take it with you!  Even if you need to go to the restroom!  They are too many opportunists ready to swipe your belongings!"
"Come here picture ready! The price of admission includes a free green screen picture that you can email yourself once the elevator takes you to the top. Choose the background you enjoy the most because you can not rescan your ticket and send more than one image to yourself. I brought my selfie stick and we actually didn't get in trouble for using it and we used it A LOT. I'm actually unsure if they are banned.,Each ticket has a specific time as to not exceed the elevator limits. The ride is less than a minute long and isn't the least bit scary. The views are breathtaking and it's definitely an experience, but after you've walked around it once, you get over it. Especially when it's really crowded. ,We watched the sunset from the top of the space needle and I recommend you do the same. Get tickets before the sun sets so you can watch the sunset from such a beautiful view! Absolutely gorgeous!"
"i love this library.  go online, reserve books and have them delivered to your local branch."
"An excellent place for those who (a) have low funds, (b) cannot commit to purchasing music, movies, or books, or even DVD rentals, (c) possess a nerdling desire to stuff as much knowledge in their minds as humanly possible, and/or (d) want to check out the third largest library in the US (in terms of books/periodicals). About three hardcore levels of tasty books and periodicals, and the cherry on top: constantly changing photo and art exhibits throughout. All killer, no filler.,The DVD section has a better selection than expected. Some Criterion titles even live there awaiting your viewing pleasure. Free movies. Perfect for those iffy titles that you're otherwise too cheap to rent and also for those awesome titles that have you shouting SCORE! inside your head. Most newer DVDs have a 2-day check out, with $1 per day late fee. I believe books now have a $0.30 per day late fee. Okay, I wouldn't screw around with this. Just yesterday I paid a whopping $42 in late fees for my slackerness, but that said, I would much rather hand over dough to our beloved library than the local Video Hut. A friendly reminder to renew online! Before the due date.,They also have an amazing extensive photo collection that can be perused online at: , . Drop down to 'Photo Collection' and type keywords to your heart's content. Los Angeles does have history! And here is the evidence. Incredible, nostalgic, and beautiful.,When possible, taking the Metro Red Line to either Pershing Square or 7th Street/Metro Center is the way to go. The library is just a short skip away and will probably be a great workout as you're hauling your borrowed gems back home for devouring."
"first thing that came to mind--""It's soooo big!!"" :) ,its clean and has AC. hahaha i came here during summer and it was heaven! lots of books and you can also rent dvd's here.,parking cost though :/ i went after 4pm. so it was $1 flat."
Best Library in Los Angeles. You can spend a day here and not be bothered by nosy people-unlike Santa Monica or Beverly hills.   It is just huge...enormous. For example most small libraries have about ten or twenty guitar books. There are probably 500 here.  The food is good downstairs too. Try the chicken salad or coffee and muffin in the morning. I also like the art in the hallway and the fountain outside.
I love this place!
"Of course, every visitor to Seattle needs to see the Needle, so I did my duty this week and went.  The view is nice, but overall I was disappointed.  By the very nature of the crowds, you are somewhat in cattle-herding mode: exact pre-scheduled arrival time, long lines to get tickets, long lines to get in the elevator, even longer wait times to get down, etc.,But the real disappointment is a lost opportunity to enhance the experience of the observation deck.  Yeah, there's cool visual displays of how things looked on a given day in the past - but really - who cares.  But geez - tell me what the heck I'm looking at.  I'm not from here ( few are).  What's the name of the body of water.  What's special about the view East vs West, etc.  Point out special buildings.  Add a little history.  ,By contrast, places like the Sears Tower in Chicago have annotated visual maps to show you exactly what you're seeing in every direction.  The only history I learned was from the cheeky elevator guide on the way up that the building on the hill was the first high school.  I learned way more about the Needle itself on the Harbor Tour!,Yet no expense is spared in the cavernous, over-the-top gift shop.  You can see where the priorities are - certainly not in adding to your knowledge of Seattle or enhancing the experience.,At $22 a person for the icon of Seattle, visitors (and Seattle) deserve better."
"Once upon a time, there was a precocious little boy named ""J"" (he hadn't earned the right to pick up the ""E"" yet) who--for as hard as he tried, could not finish his homework on time.,As luck would have it, one day Little Boy J was assigned to write a biography for, ironically, one of the most celebrated American authors and humorists ever--Mark Twain.  Now, although Little Boy J was well-read, even at the tender age of 12, he wasn't sure if he had quite amassed the depth of literary expertise to review Mr. Twain.  And, given that Little Boy J had unsurprisingly waited until the SUNDAY before the report was due to actually start, he thought it was wise to ask his mommy to take him to his local library (at that time, the Sherman Oaks branch: ,):,""Okay, my sweet little boy, but mommy has errands to run, so I will drop you off and come back to pick you up in a few hours, okay?"",""Yayyyyy, you're the best mom EVAR!"",Well, Little Boy J did not check the schedule of the library, and, to his horror, he discovered the library was closed AFTER his mom had already left.  This being before the age where cell phones grew from every tree, he certainly could not call his mom.,Thinking quickly, he decided, in what was probably a sign of things to come, the best thing to do was to do a little creative writing and write a report--using only the facts from his prodigious memory...and, okay, the dust jackets of the Twain books that he had brought with him.  By the time his mom returned, he had finished his report and his mom was none the wiser!,In the end, amazingly, he ended up with a solid ""GOOD JOB!!!"" and star-stamp on his report, which should not be taken to be an endorsement of leaving everything to the last minute.,Flash forward to the present, and fate has placed EJ's new office RIGHT next to the Central Library.  The third largest public library in the United States in terms of book and periodical holdings, EJ can now peruse all the picture and illustrated books to his content.  With a soaring architecture and events that are constantly updated, the library was reopened in 1993 after a decade-long development campaign.  More impressively, he can search for and place holds on many of the books using the , website.  EJ also enjoys attending the Help with Reading program, a free service provided by the LAPL, and can now read words with three syllables!,Plan to spend at least a day there!"
"Flames shot into the sky.  Fueled by thousands of books the fire was unquenchable.  It was the mid-80's, a rare moment I held a straight job.  I watched the Library burn from a financial tower across the street.  ,The senior broker, the one that had the coveted corner office with sweeping views yelled out to us in alarm.  Everyone on the penthouse floor ran into towards his office to watch in shock.  Black clouds billowed up.  It seemed my precious lunch hour refuge (after first hitting Grand Central Market to buy non-heirloom tomatoes and tacos de lengua) would be gone forever.,Then miracle of miracles, they restored it.  They managed to save the grand rotunda with its magnificent ceilings and frescos.  They saved much of the hybrid neo-Egyptian-Mission-Deco architecture .. don't scoff, it works.  They added a modern atrium with soaring ceilings and artwork.  They have an wonderful garden that layers it's way down to Flower with low staircases & sculpture.,This Library has extensive special collections.  They house a couple galleries with rotating exhibitions.   There are archival photos of early Los Angeles, and maps of our city in it's infancy.  Pre-google .. hell .. better yet, pre-traffic. ,The Central Library regularly hosts world-class writers as guest speakers.  Writers you adore, and writers you love to hate.  Pulitzer prize winners, CIA whistle-blowers, former Nixon speech-writers.  The Library doesn't care.  They're objective.  If you've missed them, they're available as podcasts.,There are opportunities to get involved in literacy programs ... even for beyond-hopeless adults.  Volunteer as a tutor.,Now, for you jerks who keep bitching about the 'smelly homeless perverts' who occupy the library .. those of you so 'well-off'  you manage to review 300 new restaurants per year while pulling in lower middle class wages.  What do you think stands between your ravaged bank account and the street?  If you ever get laid off you better hope you have some leftovers from your extravagant meal at Drago Centro. You better pray the Library is still standing, allowing your potentially homeless ass to take a quick nap in the stacks after washing your pits in the sink."
"My friend took me here to show me where she got married and honestly, I was thinking uh oh, is this going to be like Santa Ana's City Hall...,My trip was SO NOT BORING, the architecture and detail that have gone into making this City Hall is so thoughtful and appealing. Walking up the granite staircase made me feel like Cinderella, seriously. What happened, to SA's City Hall?  haha,Even if you don't want to have a destination wedding, just seriously consider this Hall for obtaining your wedding docs because I fell in love with its beautiful grandeur and I know you will too."
"A thorooughly beautiful landmark, surrounding by well maintained park square, then more heritage buildings.,Day 1, and I'm cycling around with no plan, but that's the way to do it since there's things to see in any direction. Even the homeless of Harrison street are interesting. Photographed one guy with his pants actually beneath his arse. Must be hard to walk like that."
"Because it's close to the crowded (and tall) SF skyline, it can be hard to appreciate this dome's sheer size. It's more than a foot taller than the U.S. Capitol dome. It's the fifth largest dome in the world ,It's a Beaux Arts masterpiece; I love the golden highlights. ,Ranked 49th in AIA's Favorite Architecture list "
"I've never really seen the city hall of any other big city, so although San Francisco's seems awfully large and strangely familiar, I figure that must be the norm, right?  Well, not exactly.  Turns out the dome is the fifth largest in the world, even bigger than the United States Capitol (you'd think that would be illegal or something, and it is--for state capitols.  Poor poor congress, always leaving loopholes.  Well, serves em right.)  Oh, and if you're wondering what the dome reminds you of (and you've been to Paris), look back at your photos of Les Invalides.  Uncanny, n'est pas?,No, I didn't do any painstaking research on City Hall, I simply took one of the fascinating free guided tours.  They go every weekday at 10, 12, and 2, and run about an hour.  For architecture or history buffs, I can't recommend them highly enough.  For instance, did you know that this city hall is twice as big as the first one, cost half as much, was built 10 times faster, and has lasted 30 times longer?  ,Even if you can't skip work for a tour, at least walk through the building sometime.  Maybe you can even drop in on a town hall meeting in the board of supervisors' room.  (They were having a heated debate over something to do with taxis while I was there).,Oh, and did you know you can vote here before election day?  Not much use for tomorrow's election, I know, but next time..."
"I'm told this is where the Mayor likes to hang out.  Haven't seen him yet, but I hope to one day meet the Honorable Mister Ed.  In other related news, I've seen former Mayor Gavin many, many times...  He has big hair.  I like that."
"Bring your out-of-town visitors here. It's beautiful! When the same-sex marriages were happening here a couple years ago, I stopped in to check it out (with my mom and her husband who were visiting from RI). I stayed for a long time, teared up, and felt so proud to live in San Francisco."
Yeuch - a nightmare to deal with anyone from here.  and the automated phone service sucks.  Got married here and that was ok - I guess because I paid for that.  God help you if you just need information that isn't available on the website - you'll have more success banging your head against a brick wall in Idaho.
"For the first time ever in the history of the United States, people of the same gender who love one another came here and got married...and were issued marriage licenses and certificates, and married by persons with the capacity to marry them.  It lasted only as long as it took to have it shut down by people who still support inequality and favoritism for straight people.  But it was the catalyst for movements nationwide---and worldwide---to bring long overdue civil rights to gay people everywhere.  I mean, really, for Christ's sake, who believes that allowing homosexual people to sanctify their unions in the traditional official manner will really jeopardize....well, ANY FUCKING THING??!!,But it happened right here, at the same City Hall where Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone were assassinated.,The building is lovely, and it's colorful history is fascinating.  When justice and equality finally prevail, I will come here to get married to the man of my dreams."
"When you go here, just think for a moment- presidents sat here. They wrote the very laws of the country, debated through the great ideas, and we get to do the same! The air on the inside is musky like you wouldn't expect for how old the building is but that's what I love about places like this, it takes you back well as much as one can go.,There is a park area right behind it to take a stroll and even horse carriages in the area, so grab an ol fashioned ride! ,Must see if your visiting philly or are a native around here."
"I got married here on New Year's Eve! It was absolutely incredible. ,Having a traditional wedding held absolutely no appeal to me, so I began researching other ideas and stumbled upon the yelp reviews for SF City Hall. ,I have to echo the sentiments of others who married here. It was amazing and surprisingly romantic. ,It's a great environment in which to say your vows to the one you love because of all the love surrounding you. I had 6 family members with me and there were a few other couples around me, all dressed up, waiting for their turn to get married. Everyone was really happy and it was great to feel the happiness of others in addition to my own."
"""This was a night of many ""firsts"": 1st GenArt event and 1st trip to City Hall.  The whole experience was cool, but not really my style.  Maybe because I come from a modeling background so my goal for the night was not sticking my nose up in the air, but ACTUALLY drink and have the MOSTEST fun I could possibly imagine (with NO drama.)  ,City Hall looked frickin' amazing though, I loved colorful spotlights hitting the staircase where models walked down.  This location made the event cool, it's historic therefore fashionable.  I'm gonna have to come back here again, just to check out the history behind the architecture, and learn more about it.  I'd say this place brings a little bit of Manhattan to San Francisco, which is ALWAYS a good thing."""
"SF City Hall is a beautiful building.  At night it's pretty lit up.,I have lots of good memories here - my senior prom, my cousin's wedding at the rotunda, and getting my marriage license!,City Hall isn't an ideal place for a dance though.  It was cool to have my prom at a historical place but the sound quality sucks in there.  It's probably due to the high ceilings.  It's a beautiful place, just not ideal for a dance."
"Looks better than the Capitol building!,I live in NYC and been to Boston and DC, and I think the City Hall in SF is the first one that I been inside. After checking your bags and walking through a metal detector, you're pretty much free to roam where ever your heart desires. The inside looks as good as the outside, and one of the few places that you can find mail boxes (which is hard to do in SF). A great place to check out if you're like me and don't always do the most touristy thing (although there're tourists here, but tons of Franciscans that also come here."
"This is an American landmark, obviously its hard to rate such a place. However, they've done a masterful job of keeping it up and the tours are great and free if you come early in the morning every day. There are different lines for different parts of the area, so be sure you're in the right line at the visitor center when it opens. Other than that, being at Independence hall and seeing it all was really memorable and mesmerizing."
"Wow!,Great library. The architecture is amazing.  Here's all the info you need to know.,The library opens at 10am on the weekdays. The parking is plentiful in a garage located on Flower Street. The first hour is $1.00 and each additional hour is $4.00. You must get the ticket validated inside the library.,The library has mutliple floors. Each is unique. Plenty of study cubicles. There is an outside park and an inside cafateria. ,I have to say the drawback of the library is safety. Yes, I did see officers patroling the library. I did feel uncomfortable due to all the bums. Plenty of weirdos, too. Thus, minus a star for comfort."
"An grand and beautiful place to have a civil marriage ceremony. Deputy Commissioner Margaret Switala performs a genuinely heartfelt ceremony. Choose the main rotunda for your public declaration of commitment.,Also a must for visitors new to the city."
"Here with the kids getting homework done, no distractions they said. Okay! With the kids Jack (15), Kimberly (8), Josh (7) and Jet (4)"
"When they renovated City Hall they won Merit Awards for the lighting, which they had to transport fixtures from Paris in order to keep the 'historic feel'. Apparently only foreign countries have that 1915 Gold Rush look. I can't help but wonder how many homeless could have been cared for in lieu of those expensive fixtures.,Hey, we're a world class city though, and someday somebody will know it because they'll find the time capsule planted in 2001. Thanks to Slick Willie it proves how classy SF keeps it: PlumpJack wine, a Fairmont menu, the Dead Man Walking Opera program, one of da mayor's fedoras & something from the Symphony. ,Wait! We're also a diverse & open minded community, so there's something from the Mexican Museum, a piece of the AIDS quilt, a certificate from the domestic partner ceremony and a 'Chinese plaque'.,To round out the capsule we also have reminders of our hits and misses: 3Com Park memorabilia, closing day of the (old) DeYoung, planned Int'l terminal at SFO & a Pokeman card.,A place can rack up a lot of history in 92 years. A lot of marriages have happened here: thank you Marilyn Monroe & Joe DiMaggio! ,It does happen to be a gorgeous building, inside & out & I've been lucky enough to plan events here, transforming the interior into exotic and amazing environments for expensive nights of good times. Just don't think about drinking red wine on those marble floors!"
"I obtained an informational flyer regarding the parking at this location. It is somewhat complicated as library rates are non-applicable when the library is actually closed even with a validation. Also, in order to get a parking validation, you must have their library card. Luckily, I have one.,Parking is quite expensive, so I could recommend that you take subway or the bus system to get to this library. This library is huge! It looks like they have a vast amount of library material. Unfortunately, I do not feel so safe coming into this library since there are ""regulars"" that are hanging outside of the entrance.,Unfortunately, the people sitting behind me are chatting up a storm. I really dislike libraries where people feel entitled to have an open conversation as though it was their own home. I would not be able to get anything done. If I had to pay for parking to come to this library, it would definitely not be worth it. ,Library Hours (You must observe these hours as if you leave after these hours out of the parking garage, you will be screwed!),M-Th 10am-8pm,Fri and Sat 10am-5:30pm,Sun and Holidays Closed,It looks like the best day to really come here is Saturday as parking is only $1 for the entire day."
"I only write this regarding the Black and White Ball and the my friends impromptu wedding here. Yeah - I have both spectrums of friends....don't ask me why? ,So for the BnW it was nice that they had used the actual building as a back drop for part of the light show....and the food and music inside was great. I never knew that the interior was so spacious and elegant looking. I can see why people throw events there. ,On the other hand I was also there one time to bare witness to my friend's wedding - which I might add didn't last and no it wasn't my fault that it didn't last.,so minus 1 star for the failed marriage - boo to you cityhall!!!"
"Incredible, timeless architecture. City Hall is one of my favorite places that hosts big bougie events. I attended the Black and White ball and was able to get all dapper dan up in this place - black suit and bow-tie. A large mezzanine equipped with multiple bars and servers lead down a huge stairwell into the main ballroom area. ,The acoustic of this place were also remarkable. Best part about it? My good friend proposed to his long time girlfriend during the dinner - booyah!"
"After reviewing this location, i decided to give it a try, as well.... this location has the best customer service, speedy results, great amount of reps available... even the security guards at the entrance were nice.  I came around lunchtime and was done in about 35 minutes!  AMAZING!!!  Best SSA location i know of!"
"Being the supportive friend i am, i accompanied the BF to city hall to obtain permits for his company's development project. (ok, maybe it helped that he promised me an awesome day was to follow). ,I took this opportunity to fully explore city hall. I've been here a few times but never really took the time to walk around. i've always known there's more than offices here.,I was invited to take a peek and witness the few same sex marriages that were happening. Oh so beautiful! The BF's eye's got big when he saw me try to catch a bouquet. ,You MUST stand in the center and look up at the dome. No you won't look like an idiot since there were tourist doing the same thing. Ahhh and the grand staircase, I asked the BF if he could have one of these added  to one of his projects, don't think it's gonna happen. ,I waltzed downstairs to look at the photo gallery that lined the hallways leading to the ""official offices."" pretty interesting art work. i know they get changes every other month or so. ,didn't see Mayor Newsom, maybe next time. DARN!"
Nothing like a history lesson up close and personal! God Bless America!
"It's the cradle of the USA. I loved the notion that I stood where George Washington once stood. The rangers gave great tours. We were fortunate in that we got to go inside the hall twice. We had different rangers on each occasion, and their respective tours were completely different. ,If you have some spare time in Philly, check it out. It's so historically important."
"Was just hanging around a little in here and only ventured around the first floor.  It seems pretty impressive (especially the area where ther are staggered elevators to take you to Floor -4 or so in the library.  They even have a science section/business/patents section.,Free wifi.  NICE.  ,On the negative side, at least in the International Language section, there seems to be lot of (educated?) bums.  I had to use the bathroom in that section and man did it stink of body odor...i think someone was even showering in there????? Grosss.......Maybe the other floors are better...."
"This is a review for the Bao & Crystal Nguyen Wedding!!!,As you entered the room swarmed  beautify decorated in pink & purple. You are immediately overwhelmed with the sheer size of the Rotunda where the ceremony will take place. ,The setup was very beautiful as the steps are the center of attention as the grom and his groomsmen, and bridesmaids stand and wait patiently for the bride to descend from the top of the stairs with her father.,NOW on to the food!!!,During the Cocktail Hour:,We were informed to ascend up the massive stairs of City Hall where we were greeted by a table of ferrero rocher on a gold table. Each chocolate described the country that you would be sitting in during the reception!! ( Verryyy classyyyy),We we then greeted into a very unique sushi bar in the middle of the room. Sashimi, Hand Rolls, Tuna, MMMMMMM The sushi was comparable to Sushi Zo in Los Angeles!!,Mini-Burgers and Curried chicken skewers every bite a different experience.,Reception:,Salad: Dungeness Crab and Soba Noodle Salad: At first my eyes could not get over how many colors and smells were hitting my palate. But after the first bite it was delish!!!,Entree: Petite Fillet Mignon & lobster Tail with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Vegetables with Red Wine Sauce.- I unfortunately am not a lobster person so my buddy Andrew consumed that one for me. ( He said mine was the best go figure lol) The Fillet Mignon was truly tasty, the first bite was like butter, the next few bites we not able to compare.,Dessert: Wedding Cake,Petite Desserts- I Have to say my all time favorites were the Red Velvet and the Lemon Curd.,This was a wedding that will make the record books for being not only modern but traditional as well. Dragon Dancers and Photo Booths, it was a magical and entertaining night."
Love this place books audio book ebooks music cd's DVD of all kind   Plus awesome art displays on every floor. Parking underground for a buck with validation.
"We visited this library two days ago - and although I don't feel it's as stunningly-beautiful as (for example) the central libraries in cities such as NYC & Detroit, it's certainly well worth seeing.  In particular, the murals on the second floor are beautiful.  There's also a small gift shop that has a nice selection, and the woman working there plus one of the men at the main information desk were both very pleasant."
"We do have a really sweet City Hall here in San Francisco. The architectural detail is really damn impressive. History and mythology echo throughout.  Highly recommend taking the free walking tour, call to find out when that is.  Flex your civic muscle and drop in to your Supervisor's office and say hi. Following in the footsteps of former Supervisor Matt Gonzalez, District 5 Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi hosts a free monthly art opening every 3rd friday from 5-8pm. This is one of the few times you can get hammered on government wine in the house of the people."
"The library has some really nice architectural details from the time period it was built. Lots of Art Deco and Egyptian style motifs and murals, most of these are located on the 2nd floor. The staff are all real nice and they'll help you find these gems, if you need help. They even have maps.,Worth a quick visit just to see the interesting architecture or check out a book if you're already in the area. But not really worth it if you have to drive out here specifically to see it, because parking around this area is horrendous. Even the parking meters are $5 an hour!  But if you're already in the area then its worth checking out."
"A year ago (2/7), the sky was gorgeous blue, no clouds, no fog, a few protestors but a nice spring feeling day ... Why do I remember this so vividly .. Got married here a year ago and then 3 months later partied up in Shanghai..  Oh yeeaahhh,SF City Hall .. .Love ya Babe!"
"If you're getting married here on a Friday, just know it's going to be busy."
"This place poses so much beauty and power, two reasons why I got married here. =)"
"I love American history and Philadelphia is the home to a lot of historic places. Independence hall being my favorite. ,You need to go to the Independence Visitor Center to get tickets for the Independence Hall Tour. It's FREE. You'll get assigned for your tour. Keep in mind to go about a half hour early for the security check.,After you get in, go to the East Wing  that's where the tour starts. The park rangers who leads the tour and gives the narrative on the history of this place is awesome. It's my second time here (1st was on 1993) it never gets old for me. I can hear the story over & over again. Seeing where the Declaration of Independence was signed and where the Constitution was debated was surreal. ,After your tour is over, you can go yo the West Wing on your own and see an original copy of the Declaration on Independence and other historical documents. ,On the grounds of the Independence Hall, you'll also find Congress Hall. This tour is also FREE. I enjoyed this tour immensely. On the first floor is where you'll find where the House of Representatives gathered. On the second floor, you will see the Senate room, the Pennsylvania Governors office and various meeting rooms. ,A historical place where everyone should visit. Being in this place puts in perspective what true FREEDOM is. ,USA USA USA!!!!"
"Love this library! 7 stories of everything you could ever need, whatever they don't have you can find on worldcat. Parking is only $1 with validation and staff is super helpful. The location is great as well, visiting this library is an all day event!"
"Best library in town. They have rare long out of print books available for viewing with an appointment. One of my favorite writers had a life changing moment in the now Children's Literature room. This is where Charles Bukowski first read John Fante's ""Ask the Dust"" and planted the seed for his eventual career."
"So beautiful. I'll never forget the private Intuit Xmas party here.... decadence defined. Themed rooms, live bands, casino games.... anyway, DO check out their live DANCE series here!!!"
"Wheee!  i got married here  last week and it was great!  ,Beautiful beautiful public, historic, i am sharing my experience with all the other lovers around the world and right here in san franicisco who decided to just do it.  vegas was such a cheezy idea looking back at the options i was considering.  ,ok thats it"
"I've always wanted to go here.  I did and I was not disappointed.  Parking garage is located underneath the building, but I'd park in the street unless you're going to be in there awhile.  I was amazed at the number of floors to this building let alone the amount of books.  I love, LOVE books and spent all day in here.  Libraries are my thing.  I enjoy the peacefulness, quiet and availability of selection of books.  They have a ""Foreign Language"" section.  Never been to a library where they offer such a huge selection of Hebrew books.  I love it and I'll definitely be back now that I have a library card!  :)"
"I came here a few weeks ago for the Seventh Annual Monte Carlo Casino charity auction hosted by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. This place was soooo packed! The lower level where the lobby is was where they had most of their food. They had food from local favorites such as Yoshi's and a bunch of other places I could not for the life of me remember. They had a lot of different types of food including Japanese, Italian, American, Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, and probably something I'm forgetting to mention. There were bars everywhere you turned mixing cocktails and pouring beer. Because we had VIP bracelets, we were allowed to go upstairs to the second floor where we had a private bar and this awesome sushi that totally kicked Yoshi's ass downstairs. We were munching on these all night and even got to do lots of exploring around City Hall after hours. I think this was the coolest part. We took loads of pictures and went up and down the elevators and hallways. We probably weren't supposed to be up there, but nobody stopped us! I must say I will never forget this experience. The City Hall looks awesome at night, btw!,Final Verdict: I was lucky enough to be able to attend this event, the invitation must be heaven sent! We ran up and down the city hall stairs, we had been drinking all night so we didn't care."
"When I was in high school, I spent a couple full days at this library to research a history paper.  My paper was on some minor European war, and my school and local libraries had very few books on point.  The downtown library had so many all in a row that I sat on the floor of one aisle, pulling out piles of books, all their call numbers nestled in the same very long and specific Dewey Decimal string.,I didn't love doing the research, but I was deeply impressed by the beautiful library, its architecture, ambiance, and breadth.  When I turned sixteen I decided I would work at a library, and ended up spending a year as a messenger clerk in two of LAPL's lesser branches.  My desire to do so stemmed directly from my research pilgrimage to Los Angeles's temple of books.,I'm more into bookstores than libraries, as I'm very acquisitive about books, but this downtown library is still one of my favorite places in the city.  It has an old majesty and vastness, with museum-like decor and the library smells of rubbed pages and book bindings.  I worked across the street for six months and enjoyed walking past it every day, as I parked in the lot ($13 a day of you get in by 9:30).  I came in during lunch just to soak up the place.  Last month, I went to an after-hours party at the library.  I drank beer on the landings, surrounded by books, and remembered the time in high school when my friend and I sneaked sandwiches outside the reading room, sitting on the floor like little urchins, hidden behind a wall.,I'm also remembering now that I saw a homeless man printing pictures of naked people when I needed to use the printers. I was a pretty sheltered fifteen-year-old, so it's a testament to the general grandness of this library that this experience was just a footnote.,Anyway, the Los Angeles Public Library is essential to our city, and I believe the central branch can put the love of books in anybody.  It's an L.A. landmark and treasure, and I expect to come in and out of it my whole life."
"Ok... so I went here this past weekend for my brother's wedding....,Sorry folks.. sorry to my friends... sorry to my other relatives.. sorry to all the rest of the people who's weddings that I'll go to... but this was the nicest wedding that I've ever been too... and likely go to.,The location was beautiful, the staircase is beautiful, it was well organized, well planned, well catered, well lit, well run... period.  Everything was beautiful... the food was great.  bummer that I had to leave early."
Doing great work for the City!
"I did not get married here, but I did get my license here. Let me just say that the building alone is a tourist attraction in itself. Dare I say it rivals the Capital of Texas? Well, almost. ,I also want to note how nice the people inside were, and I just did not expect anyone to be nice at all. In Houston at least, most city/ government workers aren't. Postal Service? Forget it. ,Still, I'm sure part of why they were nice is because we had done our homework. So, just to let you know, if you do need to visit to get your license, you are required to pay and make an appointment online before coming. Read the information and make sure you bring all the appropriate documents. If you have any questions, call ahead. I'm sure they will appreciate it, and your visit will be a pleasant one. ,The Verdict: I say even if you don't need anything here, you should take a walk inside. It is a lovely place."
"Fenway Park is, of course, review-proof.  It's Fenway, the oldest park in America.  You have to know what you're getting here.  The seats are tiny and sometimes face the wrong direction; Yawkey Way is sticky; and that fat guy in the bleachers is about to take his shirt off.   And do not go there wearing Yankees gear!  Not that I've tried that, of course, but my friend did once and he got mocked mercilessly.  He probably shouldn't have sat next to me.  ,On the plus side, after 9:00 there are sluts sneaking cigarettes in the stairwells.  And the Red Sox play there.  If you don't jump up and down like a five-year-old every time you climb the stairs and get your first look at the field, your soul is dead.  Or you're a Yankees fan, which is the same thing.  It's one of the best places in the world."
"5 stars cuz my husband Gavin Newsom is here. *sigh* But back to reality. I have fond memories of this place. My daughter's 1st grade class came here for a field trip and I was a chaperon. There's this boy in her class who had a crush on her and I really really like him. He was so respectful to her and considerate. He always watched her back.,Well anyways their teacher wanted them to walk down the grand stairs holding hands like kings and queens. She told the class to get a partner and he quickly ran to my daughter. He asked her if she wanted to walk down the stairs with him. She said ""yes."" Awwww!!!,The teacher was at the bottom of the stairs taking a picture of each ""couple"". Right when it was my daughter's turn, she ran out of film. NNNOOOO!!!!!!! Why???????,We had a fun day that afternoon."
"Come here and expect: free tickets for guided tour of a very small location of some HUGE points of American history,What I got from it: We were told that the Independence Hall guided tour was worth our time.  They were so very right.,Of course I have my hesitations regarding doing touristy things on hot summer days.  I was visiting Philly with the mindset of chilling out in a different city, and enjoying it's beer and coffee.  I could always come back and do the touristy stuff another visit.  Tourists can be weird, rude, and not the best crowd to hang with, ya know?  I think it has everything to do with the fact that it's a high quantity of people rather than the quality.   But my friend and I were willing to do the tour after some convincing reviews of the place.,I wish I could tell you which tour guide we had.  She was absolutely fantastic!!! She was sarcastic, knowledgeable, down to Earth, and cared about her position.  The tour guide worked for the National Park Service, and upheld that role very well.,As I think about this more, I now believe the tour guide could make or break your view of Independence Hall.  It's very small and very simple.  Our tour guide took away the ordinariness of the present and allowed us to enter the past.  ,I really hope you all can be time-travelers, because  for that half hour, we certainly were."
"I love baseball, the game, the stadiums, the stadium food but I'm a SF Giants fan, we're spoiled with such a great ball park and ball park food and I love the Giants. ,I'm thrilled to have had a chance to go to Fenway Park, that would be my life long dream, to visit all the ball parks of the world. Anyhoo, the ball park is a buzz and the locals say that regardless of the Red sock's standing, the games get sold out. I've never seen anything like it, everyone if not 9 out of 10 people in the public eye has a Boston Red Socks accessory or item of clothing on. The stadium, the fan store is HUGE and it's not just one, it's like multiple stores, I felt like I was cheating but I had to get a piece of the pie so I settled for a t-shirt with Fenway Park on it, can't get away with wearing Boston ever. ,The park is old but you can feel the history behind it, it's also amazingly clean and the lines for food or beer are not ridiculous, they keep to the classics, hotdog (or Fenway Frank), peanuts, popcorn/cracker jacks, and beer. I got tickets for the Chicago White Sox game with Manny Ramirez playing, this was a double whammy event to go to and bleacher tickets were sold at $75 each from a ticket broker close by. I was thinking, bleachers for 75??? Well, come Sunday's game and the bleacher seats were actually great! So close to the grass and where the pitchers were practicing, the day was gorgeous and instead of actual bleachers, it was individual seats. ,I would have loved to have some garlic fries but remembered where I was, a classic stadium with a great history. This was such a great game and location, it was well worth the sunburn and price of tickets. Boston, you are a wonderful town."
"I went there once, and only once.  The library is spectacular.  Enormous.  Thankfully, I found what I was looking for because I had researched it online (the call number of the book and what floor it was on) before going there.  Parking down there is beyond berserk though and for that reason, I have stuck with other branches closer to home.  There should be parking validation for customers of the library!"
"Originally from NY and a Mets fan,going to Shea Stadium as a child wasn't the place to make baseball memories. Fenway Park has this majestic feel like you are back in the early part of the century watching baseball. Having said that, the bathrooms and seats still reflect this time of the century, but I think its part of the Fenway Park charm. If you have never been, get tickets and check this place out!"
"I don't care how you feel about the Red Sox or the Yankees or anything else.  There is ninety-nine years of baseball history here. No other park in the country can claim this.,Sure the original 1934 seats are all that comfortable, knee room isn't the greatest (come on, people were smaller 99 years ago), and you have the charm of those obstructed view seats.,This is the Vatican of baseball.,This is the Louvre of baseball.,This is the Metropolitan Opera House of baseball.,The history inside these walls can overwhelm you if you stop and think about it. Babe Ruth played on this field. There isn't another ball park remaining that can make this claim.,If you visit Boston, take the tour, it is well worth the $15 to learn about the unique features of Fenway (the manual scoreboard) the history of the park (it was almost torn down) and how it was saved, and the larger than life people that have played there.,The idea that this will likely become a sacred, untouchable historic national landmark in the next few years is beyond exciting."
"For the love of god, please don't have your wedding or event  here. The people that run this place are extremely rude and unprofessional. I've been to a million weddings in my lifetime and this place is horrible. They have horrible sheriffs as their mall cops that are very rude. You're better off having an event at IHOP than trying to build memories there. Take my word for it!"
"It is what it is, you either like the sox, or you don't (I do).  Fun place to go if you're a fan or not.  I've been with them all, Yankees fans, Royals fans, Cardinals fans, etc, they've all enjoyed themselves, despite being a fan of the visiting team. ,Less drunk people these days as security has really tightened up after the current owners took over years ago.  The stands used to be filled with them but it's now ""Friendly Fenway"", which is good for families and the peaceful type.  But, if you want to get drunk and obnoxious, you're going to be out in the street fast.  Don't even think about starting the ""Yankees suck"" chant, as that will get you tossed, too (which sucks in of itself, but I've seen this happen countless times).  You simply have to wait for the whole crowed to immediately start the chant as a whole at once, because then no one will be singled out by security.,I can't imagine a summer without coming here."
This is an an amazing library. So many books so little time. Very comfortable in the middle of a dozen coffee shops and restaurants. There was a line for the computers - I assume thats typical but it has free wifi.
"YAY!  I have a library card now.   I used to have one years ago but not lately.   This time I need to research some design books in preparation for a project coming up.,The downtown los angeles library touts that they have FREE internet.   It was Slllllllooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!  It was not a joy.,However the staff is VERY helpful.  They will rally people to help you if you are kind, nice & considerate with them.,I saw the genealogy section and I was amazed!   A lot of stuff to study going way way way back for every ethnicity, race, creed, country, culture etc etc.   So go look up your family tree.... its cool!"
"My favorite building in the Bay Area. Have been here several times for weddings, new year parties and corporate holiday parties and it takes my breath away everytime. The architecture is spectacular. Hey, maybe I should run for Mayor so that  I could go to work here everyday!"
"Steph C is right on the money. ,I came for a few exhibits specifically the Songs of LA, but really fell in love with the DTLA library. It has great bones, architecture, just enough old mixed with new, and one of the most kick ass gift shops around.,I've browsed and checked out a plethora of books, purchased a good amount of kitschy gifts from the shop, and have to say out of all the major metropolitan cities I've lived in, LA has the best public library. Great speaker series, workshops, exhibits, and most importantly good reads.,Note about the gift shop: They also have a truck that goes wheels up for festivals or events in and around LA county, and I have found a good number of gifts for others RE: LA swag, as well as items for myself."
"Absolutely beautiful.  I can think of nothing more appropriate for one of the greatest cities in the United States.  Luckily for me we had our senior prom in the rotunda of the building and my god it was beautiful.  Almost makes me wish that I enjoyed my senior prom.  You almost forget that it is a city building, yes it is that pretty.  I love this place."
"This Library is huge! it has tons of books and lots of places to sit n read and it's sooo quiet. I love it. I could get lost in here forever. They're resources are vast and I feel like their staff is actually nice. The park in front of it is so peaceful and cute, if you don't mind the lingering odor and the occasional bum. It's a small escape from it's surroundings. ,I actually came here looking for parking I found their entrance on Flower after turning right on 5th street. Parking is relatively cheap if you can validate with your library card. Have the lady at the information desk validate your parking ticket, then pay for it on floor P1 with the electonic kiosk. They close at 8pm M-Th and 5:30 on Friday, so I think that's when the parking lot closes too. If I were closer and I had the time, I would've loved to come here and just bask in the silence."
"Near the entrances are signs for ""100 Pies"" and I searched and searched and never did find a single pie, let alone 100 Pies"
"Rich with history SF City Hall is such a beautiful building that I've enjoyed spending time in for holiday parties, wine tasting events and networking/corporate parties. Some people are lucky enough to even get married here. The Rotunda and grand staircase are breathtaking. Truly spectacular."
"This place holds a special place in my heart.,My first marriage was held here a few years ago on that cold day in February when the Mayor Gavin Newsom allowed same-sex couples to be married.  It was great while it lasted since it was nullified a few months later by the supreme court.,My girlfriend, my best friend and I left So-Cal and drove 6 hrs to get here and waited over 8hrs before we were able to know if the marriages were going to be allowed. The city employees even stayed after closing hours to complete the marriages performed that day so hundreds of couples were able to be married.  A few weeks later, the marriages were no longer allowed to be performed and the rest was history. ,If you've been to SF but have never set foot in this place, I suggest you should.  I love the architecture and the long marble staircase that lead you to the Rotunda where I was married.  It was a crazy scene.  I had a news camera in my face and at the time I was afraid that my folks would have seen it in the news, but the camera man said that they were filming for Japan. Whew! I thought. (OK, that didn't last long because somehow my mom caught me in the news anyway. Oh well.)  If ya don't know, now you know!,The vibe and buzz around the city was just so welcoming.  It was definitely worth the wait.  It's not a typical city hall, you can totally feel the history in this place.   ,It was really a life changing experience and now I know why they make those shirts ""I left my heart in SF.""  Definitely not a boring, average city hall.  This is definitely a landmark in SF that people should visit at least once in their life."
"I only wish there were more stars available on Yelp because Fenway deserves them.  To all the naysayers I only have one thing to say, ""piss off!""  Sure the seats suck (I'm 6'5"", you don't have to explain that to me), sure there are are obstructed view seats (now you see Pedro, now you don't), sure the bathrooms are packed (lets just be grateful they got rid of the trough), etc etc.  ,Don't get me wrong, I still find plenty of faults here like the ""Yankees Suck!"" chants when we are playing EVERY other team besides the Yankees.  Come on fans, get your heads out of your arses.  I hate the obnoxious fans that keep their schtick up around families.  There is no need to be swearing a blue streak and drinking like a fish around kids.  The prices are downright outrageous.  Sometimes I think you have to actually OWN the Red Sox to afford to go to a game.,But at the end of the day you are not going to have a better experience in baseball.  There is a certain magic you only get at Fenway when you walk out of one of the tunnels and behold the Green Monster for the first time.  Well, maybe at Yankee Stadium (which is certainly nice) but only for two more seasons.  Even after having gone to Fenway for a hundred times, you still feel an electricity when you walk through the turn styles.  Seeing a game here is magnificent.  I cannot wait until my nephew is old enough to take for the first time.,As much as I know a new stadium will eventually happen I hope I never live to see it.  It would be sacrilege to call anywhere besides Fenway home for the Sox.  Boston would never be the same."
"As a civic building City Hall is spectacular. The renovations that have been done to restore and enhance the structure is outstanding. Yet the politics and the antics inside at times is less than inspiring. ,Walking through the main hall to view the interior of the dome is awesome. Take the time to look and yes, walk up or down those grand stairs. Just be sure to keep your balance. They are very wide and marble can be slippery. ,On the main floor there is always some kind of display or exhibit, at the main lobby or in either the North or South Light Court. ,Presently at the grand staircase there is a sound exhibit, displaying all the sounds of the city, such as cable car bells, birds, water, etc. Yeah, it's kind of different. But as a new form of art it is rather unique. ,I guess this is when its appropriate to say, ""only in San Francisco!"" Ha! ,All visitors must go through a security check so at busy times be patient. It is all part of the routine. Since City Hall is also open to tourists, dress code is casual. ,Yet if attending a hearing or meeting with officials it is always best to dress up a bit, like business casual style. ,When attending a hearing or one of those long meetings it is important to try to be on time, otherwise you will not get a seat. Staff and protocol is very strict about that. No one is allowed to stand. ,Yet, when there is an overflow, the staff opens up a room with a large TV screen monitor to accommodate the extra people. ,Actually, sometimes that is much better. Because you can really see all the officials presiding as they speak. And, with a place to sit that is much less stress. Try standing and taking notes in an over crowded room with little or no air conditioning, no fun! ,The view from the upper floors is impressive, especially from an architecture point of view. City Hall is classic in all its details. Well worth a visit."
"It's Independence Hall...garners 4 stars based on that alone.  However, can't give it another star because it's a hassle to visit and the NPS tour is pretty boring.  IH is a must-see if you are in the area just because it's IH.,4 stars."
"Sold out game, stood in the ""pray"" line.  Green shirt screams ""95 dollah tickets...anyone want some...""  Handicap seating on third base line at the most intimate park I've had the pleasure to be at.  Got bumped to even better seating where the foul line meets the left field seats right on the red wall.  Wow.  What a night!  Great fans (even though i hate them most of the time :) and an even better ball park.  Never give this up Boston.  Nice job!"
"I once waited outside on the steps for my friends to arrive since we had a wedding rehearsal to attend here. Food trucks, peaceful strangers and sun rays with plenty of shaded areas for me to relax as I waited for my friends.,When they did, I opened the door and my high school friend was in a wedding dress! She had just gotten married! All of us are from the East bay so can you imagine how random that must've been for me. It was literally about a decade since I last saw her. I said my congrats and went inside with my other friends. The inside is gorgeous, so much detail to the walls. It was a little hot though. Now getting to the point, my friend married her love that weekend. Those steps were beautiful and I must say that the feeling I got from this hall was like an intimate vibe. A place that welcomes your very close family and friends.,Brings me good memories as I saw my own boyfriend slowly enter the building with his fine ass..... we could be next! Lol jk.,Job well done, SF."
"If your used to after school kids hopped up on Mountain Dew, who find your silence and slap it between symbols, if your used to garage sale books in need of a dustbuster, if your in need of a library shelved to the gills, this is the place. The original book of John, his original scrolls, are here. Right in the middle of downtown. So get here at 6am, or you're gonna need Mountain Dew for the 3 hour dash for a time square parking spot New Year's Eve every day"
"This just in...a Yankees fan gives Fenway Park a 5 star rating!!!!,Yeah yeah yeah...I do not like the Red Sox...I mean I am not one of these obsessed crazy baseball fans, but I have NY pride and grew up with the pin stripes so that is who I side with in their ongoing battle of baseball supremacy. But in a country that builds and rips down arenas and buildings after they are only 10-20 years old, its nice to have this American icon. ,The seats are so small but that is part of the charm. I guess Americans were a tad smaller back in the early 1900s. I saw a concert here and to show you how passionate Sox fans are about their beloved team, a Yankees suck chant broke out!? Hahaha we laughed and loved that some band got a Yankees suck chant. Great place with a great atmosphere outside too that has many bars and restaurants. Definitely check it out when you hit up Boston. Oh and by the way...go yanks!"
"Although it's the oldest baseball stadium, it's the best stadium I've ever been to, ever! You can't help but smile once you enter the area and everyone is just so passionate about the Red Sox. It was definitely worth the 8k+ miles I traveled from Hawaii. Thank you Fenway and the city of Boston for a memorable experience!"
"Love SF City Hall (or as they call it in Gotham City, the HAllllll of Justice!). Gorgeous architecture, amazing rooms, hallways, breathtaking every time I go there, and some lucky people get to actually work there! Go and walk around, you'll be glad you did!"
"One word, orgasmic. I cry every time I am here. Its an amazing experience. Its a classic ball park and you never miss a good game. I think we need like a 10 star rating for Fenway. Its not too expensive but you have to get your tickets on eBay or Stub Hub. I wish it was easier to get season tickets too but thats what happens at such a popular ball park. The Fenway Franks are the bomb and its probably my favorite place in the entire world, no doubt about it. You have not lived until you see a game here, enough said."
"I have always loved this place even when we took field trips as a kid. It's full of everything you can imagine and is constantly getting better. I like the pop library, although I think they will have to expand it because it a little small and filled with stinky people who should shower more. Or they can just get more ventilation. Nonetheless. I love it! I also love attending ALOUD, the free presentation through the Library foundation. They have a great cafe with juices and smoothies that are really cheap. It's a nice quiet place to study. Just make sure you want your stuff because a lot of street people us the library to sleep in there."
"Have you ever been inside City Hall? Gorgeous gorgeous space. The dome is higher than the Capitol Building's in DC. ,There is a soundscape ""exhibit"" going on...not sure when it ends. If you stand anywhere within the rotunda area you hear sounds representative of SF. You will hear various sounds depending  on where you stand. Go up to the highest balcony and look down....unless you are afraid of heights.,There is also a small museum in a large room off the rotunda with SF historical artifacts."
"When I gots ta study hard, and fo' reals, this is the place.  Not only is it big and beautiful, it's quiet and peaceful and happy.  Plus, where else in LA can you check out Blu-Rays fo' free!  Take the metro here and save yo'self some parkin' headache.,Who should come: Harried students, know-it-alls, avid readers.,Who should stay away:  everyone should come here.  Hell, even them illiterates can borrow a movie."
Clearly the best City Hall in town.
"You can't fight City Hall, and you can't beat it for history or architecture.,Mayor ""Sunny Jim"" Rudolph decided that the new City Hall should be an emblem of San Francisco's rebirth after the 1906 earthquake. The rotunda is actually taller than the U.S. Capitol. Why? Because Sunny Jim wanted it that way.,As Art Hoppe famously wrote ""Joltin' Joe DiMaggio wedded the girl of his and many other men's dreams yesterday afternoon in the San Francisco City Hall."" People might tell you that they were married at Saints Peter and Paul Church on Washington Square, but that's just where a famous picture of them was taken. ,There's plenty more history there. You can learn all about it by taking the free tour. Docents give tours Monday through Friday at 10:00 am, 12:00 noon, and 2:00 pm. If your friends or relatives are visiting, it's the best free tourist attraction in the City. Back when I went, everyone got to see the Mayor's office. If Willie Brown was there, he'd generally say hello. He was away that day (and keeps a very messy desk).,Some supervisors also have regular (local) art & (free, cheap) wine parties on Fridays. Worth a look."
"I have been to multiple libraries around the California area and can verify that the downtown public library has an amazing collection of books, audiobooks, magazines, and other educational resources. Their dvd and film section is very large also and you can find new and classic movies, documentary films, television shows, etc all right here in case you don't know how to use netflix,I am mostly interested in business so I can attest that the business section is filled with finance, real estate, and multiple disciplines of material. They have dvd's of recent business documentaries, essential audiobooks (on cd) and all of the latest and classic books on everything in the financial markets and business strategy. There is almost an entire floor of thousands of books and material dedicated to business.,Although it is Los Angeles and there are multiple stinky people who will cough and stink up a lot of the tables you can find solace in certain areas like the foreign languages section. ,Overall it is probably the largest library in the LA area that I have seen"
"Just a couple days ago, I said 'I Do' at City Hall. My Husband and I planned a small (6 guest) ceremony. Very simple and intimate. What a beautiful location! Even though our wedding was so simple and 'low budget', we never once felt like we were compromising on location. I may be biased, but I honestly believe that it was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever attended (And, as a Wedding Photographer, I've been to a few!).,Our Judge/Officient was so beautifully well spoken. I am not an overly sensitive sort of lady... but listening to him speak while I stood there with my soon-to-be-husband, about to say 'I Do'.. moved me to tears. It was so so touching. All of our guests were in tears as well!,We asked the Judge if he wouldnt mind doing the Ceremony on the 4th floor.. and he agree'd. We are so happy we asked! Otherwise we would have done it on the stairs... and while the stairs are beautiful, they are also very busy and the light isn't amazing. The 4th floor is MUCH more private and the light is *perfect*. Our photographer was very happy that we opted for the 4th floor--- our photos turned out beautifully with all that natural light!,All of our guests had never been to City Hall and they were all floored at how stunningly beautiful it is. It never once felt like a low budget wedding... it was simply absolutely perfect. I wouldn't go back and change a THING."
"Take me out to the ball game baby!!! Fenway Park is wicked awesome!! I don't care what anyone says about bad seating set up or small seats (yes you, you are fat the seat is not too small)  I love how everyone says Boston wants a new park, dude this place has more spirit and history than any new Fancy stadium.  I just hope I have kids soon enough to take them here, and let them experience what it is really like to go out to the ball game.  Also to all you Neil Diamond haters I know what the song is about, but I still belt it out half cocked every game and will continue to do so.... Long live Fenway!!!"
"From the standpoint of having a beautiful icon in SF, I love City Hall!  I wasn't a fan of the base color of the dome---black---but it has sort of grown on me.  The whole hall towers over you with its gold finishes almost winking at you.  When you step inside you're in for a real treat.  The inside of the dome escapes peripheral vision and the central staircase climbs high up into the distance.  You're standing in the middle of what feels like a colliseum, but less cold and more regal.  There's a photo op pretty much wherever your turn.  Friends have been married here and I swear if I ever do a civil ceremony it will be here!,The only down side, if there is any, is that the ""business side"" of the building is a maze.  I've had to go down there and run from office to office and asking very specific directions where you need to go next is a very good idea.  :),Times visited: 2"
"Totally a tourist must do! Tickets must be purchased at the Visitor's Center before hand and you must arrive early or they will push you onto the next available tour. You can go in through security to see the other buildings for free such as the Congress Building, and such. ,The tour guides and site rangers there are super friendly and helpful. They openly, although a little indifferently disperse information about the historical sights. If you love AMERICA or even have any appreciation for revolutions, this is a place to see."
"I will be completley honest, I am a yankee fan and I have been to this park many times over the years not just for yankees sox, or red sox any team, but also for the phish show last year and Dave matthews band the year before.. This place is really a true historic place and I am glad to have come here... ,However the fact is it is historic and just like most historical places its kind of a dump... Im glad its still standing but I think the city really needs to consider demo and rebuilding after the 100th season is over is (i think its 2012) or until pearl jam gets to play there :),really like the food there and its easy to park as well...,thats all"
"5 stars and I hate the Red Sox.  That says a lot about Fenway.  Any true baseball fan would appreciate Fenway for it's historical value.  This ballpark has plenty of surrounding bars and restaurants for pre-game fun.  I'm from Oakland.... our bar is called the parking lot!  Enough about me.  The food vendors outside are amazing - Fresh bun, choice of sausage, and all the peppers and onions you need.  We're not inside yet.  Ok, now we're inside.  Close your eyes and you can feel the past.  I get goosebumps as I walk to my seat.  If you don't have seats, don't wait until you get to the ballpark.  Use Stubhub or another ticket vendor and get good seats."
Went to show dogs for lunch today parked 2 blocks up on Golden Gate almost din't eat after walking down the piss soaked streets in that area SF take some pride in your city and clean it up... Sorry Show Dogs we won't be coming back . Food was good but my wife said never again in that area.
"I really really wanted to give this library more stars but I couldn't. Don't get me wrong it's a great library with a lot of offer. Great place to find a ton of books in all subjects.,They just need to work on the cleanness of the library itself. As soon as you walk from the lot into the library you're welcomed with a combo funk smell of urine and sweat. The floors, counters, carpets and studying slots need a deep cleaning. Deeeeepppp cleaning!!,I also wasn't a fan of the two people snoring while I was trying to study in the business center. Some people will roll in with their luggage grab a seat and just get their nap on. ,$1 parking all day on Saturdays and Sundays with validation."
"The absolute church. The one, the only. My home away from home during the season. This place is *haunted*, in a positive way, for all the right reasons."
"Best stadium ever.  I've been going to Fenway since I was a kid in diapers.  The older I get, the more expensive the tickets, and the harder they are to come by.,I remember coming here with my parents and sitting in the bleachers.  Those were the days.  Now it's so commercial, but the park remains as it always has...with a few additional seats...just a few.,No matter where you go for a ball game, the food and drinks are expensive.  No surprise at all.  Gotta grab a fenway frank though!! It's a classic choice of ballpark food, along with a big ol' Budweiser to top it off. ,The fans are what create the serious energy that surrounds the stadium.  You just can't help but have an incredibly great time at the park!! Even if it's sub-zero and snowing.  (Well, ok, maybe that would suck.)  ,Greatest ball park ever.  Hands down."
"We got married here today! It was really great! I'd like to add some more detail on how it all ""goes down"" since it isn't written about that much, other than the one other Yelp review (thank you, btw).,So we made our license appointment (10:30am) and then wedding ceremony (noon) reservations online. We parked in the city hall garage; it's $2.50 an hour, and there were lots of open spaces. We had to go to the second level down, but no biggie and we got a space by the elevator. I can see how that parking lot could get dirty, etc. but it was fine for us.,We went into city hall, through security (they were friendly), got directions to room 168. The building is stunning inside.,In terms of the line for room 168, when you get there, you see a line leading into the place, which you wait in if you don't yet have a number. The line moved along fine. We waited there, gave the license paperwork, and then we got a number. Because I'd printed out the license application at home, we had it filled out when we showed up--that saved us one iteration through the line. No more than 5 minutes later, maybe less, they were calling our number, and we got the license. ,Our CA drivers licenses were sufficient ID. We filed for a confidential license, and they didn't ask for any paperwork proving cohabitation (which we had just in case), they just took our word for it, although of course under oath.,So then we got the license, and they said show up 5 minutes before noon and get another ticket. We went to chill at the spacious cafe (the bathroom is by here too), and chatted with our photographer. Had some time to take rotunda photos before our ceremony, and Royce from Blurred Line (BlurredLine?) Photography rocked it for us. We actually decided to get photos done at the last minute, and I'm glad we did. He was great and the pricing was very reasonable and transparent. He even came to the Embarcadero with us after, which was great.,Went back to room 168 about 10 minutes before noon, got in line, got a ticket, hung out with our friends, and then we heard our number. We went in and met Virginia, who was to marry us. She was super cool. She clearly loves marrying people--she said she did it on a volunteer basis, twice a month.,So one thing with city hall marriages is that you don't really know where it'll happen in the building until ""the moment of."" It so happened that at noon today there was Irish dancing in the rotunda, so we couldn't go there.,What I learned, which would have been good to know before, was that if you can't use the rotunda, you can (usually? often?) go up to the fourth floor on one of the walkways overlooking the rotunda. We lucked out here and had another marriage ceremony right before us, and so while they were going first, my photographer scouted the two walk-ways and highly recommended the light in one of them being better (the less bright one, basically). So I asked if we could swing over to that one, and there we went.,BTW I was worried the day before because the website says only 6 people can be with you. including babies, photographers, and so on. And with our last minute photographer decision, we had 6 + 2 photographers. My guess now is that it's mostly an issue if you're in the small room, because it seems like generally, even if the rotunda is a no-go, you can use one of the 4th floor walkways. In that case, there's room for more than 6, yes? Anyhow there was no ""headcount"" and we were just fine on the numbers front.,For the ceremony itself, Virginia led us through simple but profound wedding vows, which she knew by heart. She was absolutely ""present and connected"" with us. It was a really special moment--I'd read good things about the ""City Hall Marriage"" experience on Yelp, but this was REALLY good. wow. Thank you San Francisco.,ps: we went for lunch at Chaya on the Embarcadero after, and that worked out really well. Good food and service, nice views of the water, reasonable valet parking. I tried to find something nice for lunch walking distance from city hall but it wasn't to be so Chaya was a good bet."
"I've never been much of a baseball fan. Well, except when the Sox are doing well... And when my Grandpa was alive I would try to watch every so often so I'd have something to talk about with him.,I came to college here in '86, and lived right on the Fenway. I could hear the cheering crowds and the National Anthem being sung from my dorm room. It was awesome. That was the year they came SO CLOSE to winning the World Series, and then lost. After that I was bitter to baseball.,Since I came back to the city to work in the Fenway neighborhood, I've slowly become a fan again - I mean, how can you not? ,I finally came to a game this past September for the first time in over 20 years. I had an amazing time, even though the Sox lost terribly. In the future I will go to games more often.,One thing I have to say about baseball games at Fenway: The experience is a Festival of Smells. The sausages, the hot dogs, the peanuts . . . cotton candy . . . you just get hit by one smell after another the whole time you're there. It's wonderful. I also love the energy of the crowd, and singing, ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame."" Such fun!,Once I also had the pleasure of coming to an event here, and it was a great time. The food served was excellent, and the views of the park were fantastic. I hope they never tear this place down."
"Chef's Salad: 3.5,Carrot cake: 3.5,Price: 4 stars!!!,If you did not know that the Library had a little shop to grap food, check it out! Good food, real fruit smoothies and desserts for a great price. Most things are under 6 bucks! Huge salads."
"My husband and I were just married at city hall and it was the perfect experience.   I had been skeptical when the idea was first suggested, fearing a factory line feeling, but it could not be further from the truth.  The building is beautiful and the officiant was caring and gentle and we did not feel rushed at all.  The occasion was very intimate, as we only had our immediate family there. ,The only minor downside is that sometimes there are many random people walking around, which may make photos difficult, but that's like any beautiful public place."
"I'm a power-user of the Central Library.  Here are the things I love:,1) Internet-based account access and book reservations.  I love being able to check my account online and renew them that way.,2) eMedia.  On the , website, I can download ebooks and audiobooks and keep them for a certain amount of time.  This is a useful thing when I don't wan to have the physical books.  I could download them onto my phone, tablet, or computer.  This was an awesome service of theirs to find.,3) The staff are super helpful.  I asked 2 staffers at an information desk a question and they were on it for the next 5 minutes.  Granted, no one else was there, but it was good to know they want to help you out.,4) The wifi is good and strong.  Of course, some areas are better than others, but I like finding a good hiding place and working for hours.,What is not good about the Central Library: ,1) The International Language area is full of men.  Some of the watch porn.  It's kind of gross.,2) I heard about the bed bug infestation, so I've been staying away.,3) A good portion of their technology books are super-outdated, to the point, of wondering why they still have it.  For history?  ,4) I'm still getting used to paying for parking at a library, but $1 isn't that bad.  I did once and it's super-crowded in the underground parking lot, even during the day.,No matter what, I'm still gonna use the heck out of this awesome library."
"Tell me, who in the hell would say ""GAWD. CITY HALL IS SO LAME! I HATE IT!"" No one. It's awesome and beautiful and I work across the street from it everyday! Yeee"
"We had our wedding ceremony and reception all in the rotunda of SF City hall a few weeks ago, and it was BEAUTIFUL.  If you plan to have a wedding there, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for you to get uplighting and a couple of spotlights.  It makes the grand interior of the building look that much more grand! You are guaranteed to love it.  It does, however, all come with a price... to rent out the rotunda for a 6pm-11pm event, it cost us roughly $13k including the cost of City Hall security guards.  There are a lot of restrictions, being a historic government building, but the event coordinating staff are very easy to work with.  Once again, I highly recommend this venue for those of you looking for a wedding location!"

(We are advised to tell callers or visitors to telephone 311 or 211, depending on the information needed).  Only the Legislative Aides (who schedules and the watchdog for the office).  The desk is litter with brochures (some are outdated) of community activities within the district.  The Aides supplies information  only ""as needed"".  Each Aide has their own files and information and sometimes they share it.  As a volunteer, you screen the telephone calls and give the messages to the Supervisor's Aides to decide how to dispatch it.   The Proclamations are written by the person designated to rewrite the information of the ""honoree"".  The volunteer would go to the Clerk's Office where the City's Official Seal is and use the embosser with a gold seal (some Supervisors use a red/white & Blue ribbons to accent the Proclamation.).  Then, the Supervisor would sign the official paper.  If other Supervisors are to sign the document, then the volunteer is to go to all the offices to obtain their autograph.  And, we have a log sheet of constituents who visits or calls in.  There's more but this should suffice for now.  Over and Out."
"This library is absolutely unreal. In fact, when I walked in, I felt like I was walking into Union Station until I saw all of the books! LOTS AND LOTS OF BOOKS! WOW! Apparently, visitors and patrons can take docent led tours throughout the library, which is something I will have to do when I have more time. I attended a program here and the Mark Taper Forum is gorgeous! I definitely have serious library envy and I can't wait to discover more. There is ample parking, but it can get pricey if you don't validate your ticket so be sure to have your library card with you."
"Free tours at 1000, 1200 & 1400. You can also go in and just wander around up to 8pm (technically). We went one day after dinner and weren't let in to just wander. When we returned for the 1000 tour there were lots of people wandering around not on the specific tour. The tour though is worth it if you can make 1 of those 3 times. On the tour you get into rooms you can't access on tour own. The guide was so full of knowledge and so willing and eager to share stories. The 45-minute tour lasted about 80 minutes and was so informative on the building, architecture, symbolism, history of the city, etc... I recommend arriving early (or staying after) to walk around the 4th floor. It's the judicial center and not on the tour, but the guide said you can go up and walk anywhere the door is open. It's been designed to resemble its 1916 state, though is currently not the judicial branch's location (they outgrew it and moved to a new building)."
"Obviously, the best park in Major League Baseball, and probably any sporting event here in the US. Also obviously, very pricey for everything (tickets, food, drinks, etc). But, it's a must-do for any Boston-area native, or anyone who is able to plan far enough ahead not to pay a scalper double the ticket price the day of a game (by the way, doesn't anyone find it odd there's a no-scalping gate? Shouldn't they all be no-scalping, since, you know, scalping is supposedly illegal?),The one and only way to get here is by the T. Don't drive in unless you are a moron and enjoy paying $25+ to park within a mile radius of the stadium (well, not exactly, but close). If you're really into the whole stadium thing, take a tour so you can get to see all sorts of behind the scenes stuff, but definitely come for a game, as it's an unforgettable experience."
"Great Ball Park.  Great Venue.  Great Staff.,My Family and I was at the Venue last week during the Friday night game vs the Texas Rangers.  We have a larger stroller that would not fit under the seats, heck it barely fits in the back of the SUV. (the official statement from Fenway is ""Strollers and Diaper Bags are welcome at Fenway Park provided that they can fold up easily and can fit beneath fans' seats.""),But what I read after some internet research is that Fenway is stroller friendly and you can check in your stroller inside the ball park if it doesn't fit under the seats.,If you have a Large stroller, after getting your tickets scanned, head over to Fan Services/Information behind home plate.  It is next to a Souvenir stand across from food vendors.  Here you will meet Al, who is a great employee of Fenway Park.  He was really great and showed me the storage closet where he locks your stroller in there for you and guards it with his life.. well maybe not his life, but you get the drift.  After the game was over, you just go back to the Fan Services area, say hello to Al and ask to pick up your stroller.  No Fees, questions or rudeness at all.  This is a great service, especially for families with larger strollers.  Having gone to Fenway park,  we rode the T to and from the game with my child safe in her Stroller.,Some other Notes:  The storage locker is just a storage locker and Al keeps it locked, but Fenway Park is old, so don't expected some State of the art storage.. its just a large room with some pipes and room for stuff and strollers."
"How Fenway Park could receive less than 5 stars is beyond me... Fenway is obviously an American icon and has withstood the test of time. A Boston ""must"", Fenway Park holds tremendous sentimental value for Bostonians and fans from all over the world. Fenway Park is pretty much the exact same from when I first walked through its gates over 20 years ago. The only bittersweet is the seating. If you are looking for plenty of room, I would suggest watching the game on NESN. However, the lack of leg room is part of the experience that so many fans have known to love! I could not imagine going to Boston and not catching a game at Fenway!"
"When I was a child, my parents used to drive my brother and I absolutely , crazy when we were on vacation.,""It's so PREEEEEEETYYYYY!!"" was the constant refrain from the front seat.,I'm surprised Brother and I even still have functioning eyeballs, due to the mass quantities of eyerolling that occurred in the backseats of family vehicles between the years of 1989 and 1996.,Do you know what I think about City Hall?,It's so pretty."
"Where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution wassigned, Independence Hall is your destination in Philadelphia especially if you are a sucker for American history!,To access the building itself, you need to get free tickets either through advanced online reservation or by waiting for same-day tickets in the Visitor Center. If your schedule is flexible, you can risk acquiring same-day tickets by waiting in line early or by directly asking the rangers later in the day. However, I highly recommend reserving it online to not miss out this important piece of history!,A ticket will get you a 15-minute introductory lecture in the East Wing room, and after that, you will enter the building's first level where there is Philadelphia Supreme Court's first courtroom back in the colonial room and the Continental Congress meeting room where the Declaration was adopted and signed. ,Be warned though: while I personally enjoyed this tour because I'm a history major wannabe, I think this whole process of entering to see the two rooms (Reserving and picking up tickets, waiting for the next tour, sitting through the lecture) can be a huge hassle with little reward if you are not into history. Certainly this is a must-go if you are traveling to Philadelphia, but I think you will enjoy it only if you have interest in history especially the American history.,---,tl;dr version:,1. Free tickets required (Consider reserving online!),2. 15-minute talk followed by hall access,3. May be huge, boring hassle if not a history freak"
"I loved the park.  I have been mostly to new parks, such as the Angels and the Mariners, so it was quite a joy to be in Boston at a Red Sox game.  I felt all the history and all the excitement.  I sat in the outfield, and in hindsight should have gotten better seats, but if I am ever in Boston again, I will definitely take in another game.  Only bad par is that they lost.  Boo Hoo.  I am a fan."
"Red sox!,I suggest everyone do the tour before going to watch a game here...it makes the experience that much better. You get to learn all these cool historical facts, go out to the field, check out the green monster...omg it was amazing.,I recently spent a weekend in boston to watch the white sox play the red sox. Watched two games, one from the 3rd base line and the other out in the bleachers.  Both seats were amazing...bleachers are low to the ground and right next to the bullpen.  Row 1 and 2 are right at the bullpen and row 3 is the actually the first row of bleachers (there is a walkway separating 1&2 from 3) Definately the seats to have, getting up for people trying to get food/go to bathroom and you dont have the guilt of having to bother anybody to do the same. Also row AA  the box seats are great too. you can rest your feet on the rail and pretty darn close to the field.,DEFINATELY EAT THE FOOD OUTSIDE, ITS FRESH OFF THE GRILL! INSIDE IT IS BOILED OR STEAMED.  I GOT THE GRILLED MONSTAH DOG. DELICIOUS IT DIDNT STAND A CHANCE. LINE IS A LITTLE LONG BUT WORTH THE WAIT. If you are trying to save a few bucks you can bring in peanuts and bottled water/pop from outside.  I think bottles need to be sealed (not 100% sure but better safe than sorry),Nobody does the 7th inning stretch like Wrigley BUT I could sing sweet carloine over and over...by the 2nd game i was waiting anxiously for it to play so i can stand and sing and video tape the crowd getting into it...JUST LIKE FEVER PITCH...i think first 20min of my first game i just kept thinking ""i feel like im in the movies "",Maybe its the cubby/wrigley fan in me, but i was a little sad the beer guys didnt serve to everyone...only the first 10rows off the grass. I mean it kept me sober because i didnt want to miss any of the game.,I was pretty surprised and how relaxed security is here, i guess it helps maintain that family friendly, but nobody checks your tickets and restricts you from entering a different seating area.....so anybody, even the nose bleed seats, can work there way down to the field to get an awesome snap shot.  ,Ill definately be going back and try to bring friends with me!"
This is a long toime coming.  I went to Fenway in 2006 and watched them play Baltimore.  And whomever rates Fenway Park less than a 5 should not be aloud on Yelp!!!!
"I went to school at the University of Michigan (think giHUGEic stadium, obnoxious amounts of school pride, and history and tradition like very few places in the country).  And honestly, not the biggest fan of the Red Sox.  My friend and I came here for the ballpark.  ,In terms of stadiums I have some ridiculously high standards (again, Michigan Man).  Small seats, large fanatical crowds, and a great history are a must.  Fenway Park does all that.  The seats weren't tiny, I'm used to about 18 inches of belacher seating.  These seats were good enough for a 3 hour baseball game.  I watched the crowd do the wave several times around the park and thought ""okay yeah they're pretty into this.""  And wow what a history, which the giant screen made sure I knew after practically every batting change.  Oh and the Green Monster is great.,Had an awesome time, planning on going again every chance I get."
"Flew All The Way From Long Beach, CA to Catch my Red Sox & Yankee Series..,Nothing More To Say, Its Fenway Park, Oldest Ball Park in MLB, Watched My Red Sox In Action....Enough Said!"
"The greatest ballpark in the country! There is nothing better than a Fenway Frank while watching the sox! ,If you're with kids be sure to take then to fan services. They give children bracelets, stickers and buttons that say ""my first game at Fenway!"" They are too cute!! ,If you're with a group of friends trying to have a good time be sure to check out First Base Bar after the game. It's a really cool place to grab a drink right under the stadium on the first base line. ,A Boston staple! So much to see! The environment is fun and everyone loves the Red Sox!"
"It's supposed to open for public from 1--3pm, and we got here at 12:20, around 1pm, it was dozens of people from all over the world waiting outside to take a look of this great building inside, but two guys came out at 1:18 and telling us it's cancelled today... What a joke ! Shouldn't be posted like days or at least hours ahead instead of wasting people's time ?? Welcome today francisco"
"I am a like a kid at a candy store whenever I visit the library.  I used to work across the street and often find myself just wandering through aisles, perusing what title I'd borrow during my lunch break.,The building itself is pure eye candy.  The great dome room and the atrium is amongst my fav to walk through. ,There are plenty of places to sit down outside the library to find peace in the urban jungle. Just watch out when there's field trips from local grade schools as this will disturb the peace.  ,It's also convenient to borrow a book at the library as you can simply place a book online and are notified when the book is ready. All you have to do is pick it up. So for those who doesn't have the time, this is the best route to go.  ,Make sure to take advantage of their seasonal sale, that the bookstore holds.  You'll find great deals on books and other fun knick knacks."
"Fenway Park broke my baseball game cherry last night.  I know FP's like 95 years old and dirty, but I'm an adult.  I make my own decisions.  Stop judging our love.,Sure Fenway Park is crowded and you have to offer up your first-born child just to get a ticket.  Sure it didn't offer me a lot of action last night (aren't ya'll supposed to actually hit the ball?).  But it's Fenway Park.  Something about being there just feels magical.  Or it could be all the beer talking, all the crazy crazy amounts of beer.  But whatever, whoohoo!  Go Red Sox!"
"One star lost because they aren't the Giants.  But seriously, I don't think I have ever seen such passionate fans before.  And I have been to quite a few ball parks across the US.  Sans the evil empire.  ,It's hard not to get swept up in the mystique of the Fenway.  There is so much history in this ballpark and as an outsider, I could understand why the red sox have such a loyal fan base.  They deserve the success in sports that they have received as of late.  The fans are so passionate and they not only know every stat about their beloved Sox but also other teams as well.  ,The stadium itself is a good change from many of the new modern stadiums that I have been to.  The history is palpable with iconic features such as the green monster and the pesky pole.  Fenway offers a very barebones experience as there is no coca cola slide to speak of and the concession stands primarily served the typical hot dogs and beer.  It's a welcoming change from ATT Park but I would take a Giants game over a Sox game anytime."
"San Francisco's City Hall is beautiful inside!  I have seen a number of wedding ceremonies held here, and what a lovely place to have it.  The architecture is just gorgeous and will make you go ooo awww, lovely.  I go here to pay my property taxes, and while I am there, I always make it a point to walk around and enjoy it there too.  It is especially festive at Christmas time with the beautiful Christmas tree and decorations.  I've also been there for events like dance performances and seeing Tony Bennett sing his famous ""I Left my Heart in San Francisco"".  I know that they also have Zumba classes available here and there are food trucks at lunchtime on Fridays.  What a great well-rounded place - love it!  I know no other city hall like it!"
"What a fun experience to be at Fenway.  Sox lost at the game we were at, but it was still really fun.  People had flown all the way from Milwaukee to support the Brewers.  Fun times.  The hot dog and sausage were amazing.  You gotta go!! :):)"
This library is a good place for studying however the wifi chimes in and out when using your device. I was disappointed when I tryed to use some computers and found out they're reserved! Wtf??? Anyways enjoy :)
"After living in Los Angeles for over two decades, I FINALLY made my way down to the Central Library.  Although I was very impressed with the selection of books, the ease of check-in and out of books, and the very friendly and helpful staff, I don't find it clean at all, and filled with very odd and creepy people.  The location is okay--a bit of a far walk if you take the Metro Red Line from the station to the library.,Perhaps I'll go back again soon but no decisions made yet."
"I can't comment on city hall services but 5 stars for the beautiful venue! ,Came here for my hubbie's company holiday black and white soiree. The grand staircase was stunning - but ladies watch your step in your heels.  Open bar and passed hors'doerves were in the lobby while seated dinner was in the side rooms. Although it seemed quite grand with soaring celings reaching the dome, it didn't feel too vast for  300+ guests.,There was plenty of free street parking Saturday night after 6:30."
i got married here. Nuff said
"This is truly an amazing architecture and boosting an even more beautiful interior. Been here in the past for the famous Black and White Ball event as well as several other fashion show events. Every time walking up and down the grand staircase, I feel like I'm strutting my stuff and channeling the catwalk of Paris or Milan but only this is the City Hall of San Francisco!"
"Another gem to discover in DTLA. I can feel myself spending hours here and getting lost in CDs, movies, and books.  ,Go to the 2nd floor to admire the interior beauty of this public library.  There is also a room where they can have exhibitions which felt like an art museum space to me. ,I usually pass by it and never bothered to go in until recently when I was feeling adventurous. ,I loved the self-checkout stands and their huge collection of CDs and DVDs."
"Designed by Arthur Brown Jr., who was responsible for the War Memorial Opera House and Coit Tower as well, this impressive structure - which has attained national landmark status - dominates the Civic Center and serves as the seat of city government. The building's two most noteworthy features are its magnificent dome and the sweeping grand stairway inside the main entrance, which is flanked by light courts used to stage exhibitions and public events. The extensive seismic retrofitting that followed the 1989 Loma Prieta quake included a relocation of many of the offices that regularly deal with the public, making the facility much more user-friendly. Docent tours are offered Monday through Friday at 10:00am, 12 noon, and 2:00pm."
"It's huge, it's gorgeous, the librarians are amazing. Everything positive that's already been noted it totally true! This is just a few things I like about the Central Library.,It's amazingly easy to get to on public transportation! It's walking distance from the 7th st/Metro station where the Red/Blue/Purple/Expo lines meet up. Also, most bus lines that go downtown stop nearby.,$1 parking on weekends and after 3pm on weekdays!,The outdoor gardens are really nice for a photo shoot. Engagement, student project, whatever. You can even have weddings here! ,Don't miss the monthly used book sale and make sure you check out a docent tour sometime!,P.S.,I've been going to this library since before it burned down. I've never been harassed, accosted, or seen a crime occur. That said, watch your stuff, just like in any other public space. I see people stupidly leaving expensive things on tables and carrels and it's just a bad idea, anywhere. Also, homeless people hanging out at the library don't want to be bothered and they don't want to bother you."
"I got an email from my sister asking if I wanted to go to a wedding of her dear friends at SF City Hall on October 17, 2009. I checked my calender and I was actually in town, and said yes. I thought, well, this will be one of those 5-minute-after-getting-the-license-at-City-Hall type weddings. Not sure why I was invited. ,Woo hooo, was I Wrong! ,This wedding was like no other wedding I have ever attended and like not other I probably ever will attend again. It was a once in a lifetime experience for all 100+ guests.  They weren't just getting married at City Hall, they were renting out City Hall for 6 hours!,It was a black and white affair, with friends and family flying in from Berlin, Munich, Greece, L.A., New York, MIami, Hawaii plus the local friends from Atherton, Carmel, and the Nob HIll neighbors! ,We entered city hall and were welcomed by a quartet of trumpeteers playing several fanfares of majestic revery as we were handed champagne flutes. ,Then we were invited to enter the gorgeous Rotunda under the gold gilded dome, a cavernous, breathtaking sight with its huge marble center staircase. White orchids were everywhere. The Starlight Strings octet played beautiful songs like ""Some Enchanted Evening"". ,Panis Anglicus - a beautiful aria was sung by Leslie in an enchanting soprano operatic voice. ,Biset's Habanera from the Opera Carmen played as our beautiful bride, Suzanne, in her stunning red formal chiffon gown and her dashing groom, Dimitri, in his black tuxedo, descended the main stairs, moving past a double helix ring statue especially made for them. ,Nella Fantasia was read by Tina and sung like a nightingale by Leslie.,Pablo Neruda's ""And Now You're Mine"" was read with heartfelt warmth by Susan and Jorg. ,The service was delivered with such grace by Hank. ,And the bride and groom, well into middle age, were glowing and bubbling with love for each other at every moment, every turn. WIth warm glances, gentle laughter, near tearing at their vows. They tried to smooch 3 times before they were supposed to seal the deal!,It was beautiful!,And after this enchanting ceremony, the party started in the same rotunda after a receiving line in the landing above the marble stairs and a mixing of more refreshments and fabulous finger food as the tables were being set below.,As we were seated, Candace, who flew in from Kahala, Hawaii, sang the always lovely Hawaiian Wedding Song in Hawaiian. So beautiful. I love that song.  ,And as the meal was served, HIlary Cole, who flew in from NYC's Birdland, sang several jazz tunes inspired by love. She was the only professional singer of the 3, and she was gorgeous and had a smooth voice and charming personality. She is big in Japan, too. ,A great heartfelt speech by son-in-law David, and plenty of good food and drink catered by the excellent Melons catering.,Later the disco came out and a nice mix of songs got the now ""feeling happy"" guests cutting the marble and lifting their spirits with pleasure.,The night went on until 11pm, and everyone had a unique, once in a lifetime, joyous and memorable experience. This was mostly made not by the opulence of the ceremony, but by the warm, sincere grace of the charming couple who genuinely made everyone attending, guests and help, feel close to them as they shared the happiest day of their lives with family and friends.,I knew the bride, but it is my sister who has known her for 2 decades and has been her Muse of Muses. I was my sister's date but felt honored to be there and see the love radiate out from this happy couple.  ,Despite everything appearing overwhelming well planned and executed, I did hear about some of the minor issues, since my sister was asked to assist in the production. But none of the minor flaps would ever detract from this fantastic wedding, made all the more special by the beautiful venue that is San Francisco's City Hall Rotunda. ,Trust me, this was not the normal SF City Hall wedding after getting the license ceremony."
"For all of us who don't normally act totally nuts and rude, Fenway Park is a great place to give in to crowd mentality / Sox fanaticism by chanting things you wouldn't say.. or think.. or commission an artist to render an abstract sketch of.. beyond Yawkey Way.,Fenway is also a beautiful, historical, community-strengthening, feel-like-a-kid, feel-the-love kind of place.. it just demands a five-star review.,But it's expensive as hell, which sucks. In 2005, the average face value ticket price was $44.56, by far the highest in baseball. Of course, the games are all sold-out, anyway. So if you didn't have the foresight or time to buy tickets months in advance, you have to resort to the secondary market. ,At Stub Hub, tickets for upcoming Friday games range in price from $75 to over $1,000. However, to get two seats together, you have to shell out at least $236. The Red Sox also have an online service called Red Sox Replay where you can buy unused season ticket holder tickets at a significant 20%+ markup -- and oh yeah, you need a $50 subscription just to join the site.,The Red Sox today are one of the hottest teams in professional sports. But it hasn't always been that way. In 1985 when Roger Clemens struck out a record 20 batters at Fenway, only 13,414 were in attendance. Popularity comes in waves, and fans come and go. Today, the Red Sox are pricing their truest fans right out of the park, and when the team falters next, I'm pretty sure Boston, fed up with too few seats and too high prices, will stick it to them hard."
"I am thoroughly accustomed to seeing my beloved Phillies at the new-ish Citizens Bank Park, so century-old Fenway was quite a change of pace! I was very lucky to be given a free ticket to last Sunday's Orioles game and even better, our seats were amazing. It was so neat to be in a place that had existed for such a long time, and I feel it's been maintained fairly well considering the thousands upon thousands of visitors it has for several months out of the year.,My only complaint is.... the concession stands were SO confusing. Within about 20 feet you have three separate lines: one for beer, one for ice cream, and one for sodas and food. Nowhere is there a sign that says which line is for what, you just sort of have to figure it out. I spent probably 10-15 minutes waiting in the wrong line for no reason, while missing the game! Ah well."
"Great atmosphere, great team, but seats made for 100lb midgets."
"I have come here A LOT for Red Sox games, and I love the small, old feel of Fenway (reminds me of Wrigley from back home!). The best food here: italian sausage with peppers, and the KETTLE CORN! The best beer here: Blue Moon (yes indeed, they DO have blue moon.. on like ONE tap... so you have to hunt for it, though sometimes they switch it to Shock Top, which is an okay substitute). ,On my most recent trip to Fenway, I had to deal with the help desk/customer service table to resolve an issue with my seats. And I cannot BELIEVE how amazingly friendly and accommodating they were! It was seriously some of the best customer service I have EVER received! VERY impressed! Makes me want to go to Fenway even more often than I already do!,Go Sox!"
"i love this location, the front park is great to walk and take photos. on fridays you have coffee and goodies for sale in front of the city hall."
"Wow, wow, wow! History was made here. Please make sure to check it out. You won't regret it even if you are not a history buff. It really humbles you to see this place and to experience the beginning of the nation."
"FENWAY PARK is my church.,RED SOX is my religion.,I want a shirt that says this.,I've been coming to Fenway for the past 8 years -- I used to be the anthem singer for the Trenton Thunder (Formerly the AAA team of the Sox) and was invited up several times.  The first time got me hooked.  ,Like everyone said.. it's a full-out party!!  As soon as we walk up Boyleston and turn up to Yawkey Way...my stomach gets those butterfly feelings and I see the sign.. FENWAY PARK... ahhh.. it's like Angels singing in my ear.  Then you hear the band playing in front of the Yawkey Way store, you smell the sausage, you see the kids throwing the baseball to the guy on stilts, a kid getting a tattoo of Wally on their cheek and you know... you are home.  This is my 2nd home.  If I could die in the outfield or be buried there, I'd want to.  Then I could watch the games all the time. =),The food is half decent -- the restaurant in the State Street Pavillion is a little overpriced, but heck, it's Fenway.  The end of the 8th inning, make sure you get ready.. when you hear the beginning strains of Neil... it's ""Sweet Caroline"" sing-a-long time... and you'll be 'touching meeeeee... touching youuuuuuuu' (and your neighbor in front of you...and the hot guy behind.. just be careful, his girlfiend might not like it..) =)"
"Being a National League guy from the west coast I found the tour invaluable. The lore, history, even the lay of the park became familiar and added to our enjoyment of the game later that evening.  Highly recommended, especially if your unfamiliar with The Boston sports scene.  Go Sox!"
"A baseball Shrine,This place is unbelievable, and I am not a Red Sox fan...far from it. Everyone who enjoys the game of baseball needs to visit two ballparks more than any other in the country and Fenway Park is one of them. Wrigley field being the other.  When you first walk in and spot the monster, your jaw will drop as mine did. You sense the history of the place and the beauty, even out on the street. Get there early and walk around, take it all in and take pictures. The place is really old       (obviously) so when it fills up its tight, takes forever to get around  to get food or go to the bathroom, that takes a few inning sometimes. The seats are tight and isles extremely skinny, but that  is what makes the place so great. All around amazing baseball experience, a true baseball shrine!"
"Since there have been almost 250 reviews I will try and keep this short. ,Being 6-3 I wish the seats had more leg room, I am literally in pain after watching 9 innings with grandstand seats.,I wish the prices were cheaper.,I wish all the seats faced home plate rather than random directions.,I wish there were less seats with obstructed views. ,I really wish they were building a new park.,However, I am a die-hard red sox fan and I do enjoy the history of the place and I have fond memories of going to games with my dad when I was little and beeegggggging for a hot dog and ice cream. Along with that Mr Henry and his ownership group have done a wonderful job trying to update the park and get the most out of a 90 + year old stadium (golf clap for you sir) Therefore I cannot give it anything less than 3 stars.,I love the place and I love the sox, but I would say anyone giving it 5 stars is a crazed fan-boy who ignores the truths of the place, a midget, someone very rich, or a tourist whose only been the Fenway once."
"""Ortiz hits it into deep right, back is Sheffield, we'll see you later tonight!"",""Little blooper center field, Johnny Damon running to the plate, and you can keep on running to New York. Game 6 tomorrow night."",""Curveball-- He struck him out! Clay Buchholz has thrown a no-hitter in Boston tonight, and it sends Fenway into a frenzy!"",""Ramirez to DEEP LEFT! LONG GONE! Number 496!"",""HIGH ... DEEP ... GONE! The Red Sox walk off with the win!"",Enough said."
"OK I'm a Sox fan so of course I'm gonna say Fenway is the greatest ballpark on the planet but even someone that isn't a Sox fan would have to agree. I would recommend any fan of baseball, or history for the matter, visit Fenway at least once in their lifetime.,Fenway park is old, that obvious, but it actually has a lot of really cool unique features that make it feel slightly updated without taking anything away from the history of the ballpark. The new HD scoreboard is really nice yet they still change the numbers inside the green monster by hand. The first time you walk into Fenway it's a magical experience that will take your breath away. Even when the Sox aren't playing that well you feel like something special might happen because history is on the home teams's side. ,Like any MLB ballpark Fenway is expensive. A beer is going to cost you an arm and a leg. A Fenway Frank isn't cheap. But you are paying for the experience. The concessions actually aren't too bad for a ballpark that is 100 years old. The ballpark staff are friendly. At a recent game this past year I had standing room only tickets but wasn't feeling well. An usher went out of her way to find us seats and they were awesome seats overlooking homeplate. Boston fans on the other hand can be a bit rough around the edges. Don't come into Fenway wearing the opponents team gear or you will get heckled. If you dare, try wearing some Yankee gear into Fenway and you're probably going to get into a fight. Mostly though its all in fun. ,Outside of the park there is so much to do along Landsdowne Street. I highly recommend arriving early and taking in the pregame atmosphere. It's unlike anything in baseball. There's a lot of cool places to shop and eat before or after the game. ,Honestly, even if you are a casual fan or don't care about sports you have to take in the experience of Fenway at least once before you die. Just be sure to bring plenty of cash and don't wear your Yankee garbage."
"Very cool historic experience attending a game. Lives up to the great reputation that Fenway has and proves that you do not need high tech amenities or a new ballpark to have the best experience. The Red Sox truly have great fans and are always sold out. This adds to the communal experience that is unmatched by any other sporting venue that I have gone to. If you are in Boston around summertime, it is a must to attend Fenway."
"A Red Sox game is like a full day experience.  Went on the stadium tour and to a game while the Dodgers were in town during the 2010 season.  Overall it was a enjoyable ballpark.  Beware: old wood seats with no leg room.,It marked the return of Manny Ramirez to his old stompin ground.  Dodgers got beat real bad."
"San Francisco City Hall is one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. They take great pride in City Hall. In fact they are Leed certified. A huge, old building be they work so hard on making the world a better place. The workmanship and details of  City Hall are amazing. Stop by! You will not be disappointed!!"
"Probably the most beautiful building in Downtown LA . The architecture is a mixture of various types . If you love architecture and appreciate it definitely come . The staff is very helpful and nice , one girl walked around with me looking for a book and recommended a few . The small cafe inside serves great sandwiches that can go down smoothly with the daily soup of the day ."
"since there's no chance i'll be back this year, it's time for a review.,ah, fenway. inside your walls, i have laughed, cried, cheered, stumbled around drunkenly, professed my love for jonathan papelpon, gotten yelled at by a dude wearing a pineapple-print hawaiian shirt, hawked t-shirts at random passersby, rocked out to the homeless drummer guy, chanted 'yankees suck,' done the wave more times than i care to remember, rocked a bikini in the bleachers' summer sun, seen jose canseco pitch, watched manny disappear into the green monster, worn the rally cap, watched a friend puke on himself, suffered losses, and savored the wins.,love that dirty water, boston you're my home."
"For baseball fans, visiting Fenway is akin to Catholics visiting the Vatican. Love Boston fans or hate them, you can't deny the magic that is Fenway. The vibe outside the park is as much a part of the magic as inside. Great street vendors, raucous fans, and a good time always.,Favorite feature? The architects initials in braille, on the Green Monsta. (Little known fact: a buddy of mine helped with the iron work at Petco Park, and I've got a picture of my initials, welded on the third base ironwork, and now buried under concrete in the park.)"
"We made our appointment online, 3 hours apart for marriage license and ceremony. That was probably overkill, but that's what one website recommended. They are so amazingly efficient here, it totally did not take that long. Less than 10 minutes to get the license. But in the mean time, we waded into the park, had some amazing street truck food, and walked over to the Asian Art museum that had the terra cotta soldiers! ,We had beautiful non-denominational vows, nowhere did I vow ""to obey"", no ""death to us part"". None of that silliness. It was just lovely. The person who wed us volunteers to marry people! What a cool volunteer job!,We opted to get married in the veranda. It was amazing. Such a beautiful setting. It felt private despite being in a public place. ,-1 star to the state of California for not allowing gay marriage (this is after all, the former state capitol building)"
"Although it's not America's Most Beloved Ballpark (that distinction belongs to the Oakland Coliseum), Fenway is still an awesome place to watch a game. Watching a game here has been a dream on mine and I'm glad I got the chance to do it.,I was able to touch the Green Monster, walk down Lansdowne Street and Yawkey Way, eat a Fenway hot dog and sing Sweet Caroline before the bottom of the 8th. ,If you're a die hard baseball fan from any part of the country, you have to visit this baseball cathedral. AWESOME!"
"Hats off to Mitzy Y for being the 1st yelper to review this grand institution! My favorite location is the historic Downtown branch, with it's art exhibits, great architecture and helpful staff. It seems that half my life is spent researching. I bought a Vupoint portable scanner to hang out in the extensive reference sections to scan away. There are at least a half dozen of us geek-brains at any given time with our dang scanners. ,This library compliments the other impressive, large library systems in LA including Santa Monica and LA County. LAPL has the most extensive selection. You can browse the catalog online, reserve books and have them waiting for pickup at a local branch of your choice. After saving about $1,500 this year on books (not that I would have actually bought that many) I am happy to pay my occasional fines and buy used books at the Friends of the library sales. ,Go LA libraries!"
"I noticed that there are no reviews about Business Registration, so I thought I would post my recent experience.  It was surprisingly positive overall, but if you are looking for insight on how to avoid the long lines coupled by unavoidable disorganization that always accompanies government processes -- here's what I have learned:,  ,The Business Registration instructions on the .gov website will tell you that you must first pay the tax collector upon registering your business BEFORE you can register your Fictitious Business Name.  Well, it's a little more involved than that.  Luckily, I went mid-day on a Wednesday and was out of there within 30 minutes (a personal best!), but were there appropriate lines waiting for me, it certainly would have been one of those ""But I didn't know I had to wait in THAT line FIRST!"" kind of disasters.  Here's your guide to efficiency:,When you arrive at the main entrance at City Hall, proceed on the main floor to the back left (SW) corner to Room 140, the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector.  When you get to Room 140, beware of instructions that tell you to wait in line (btw, we had all of our paperwork filled out and ready to go).  Instead, when you enter the room, you will see a long, low wooden desk to your right covering almost the entire length of the right wall.  START THERE.  ""I am trying to register my business.""  The desk person will direct you to someone behind you in a cubicle.  Despite their condescending and sour demeanor, work with the cubicle person as they give you instructions, send you to wait in line to make a payment with check, cash (in person) or money order ONLY (no debit card option at this stage), and then run back to the same cubicle person with the receipt, and she will give you paperwork to submit to the County Clerk's Office (and hopefully devoid of snarky remarks).,Next, proceed along the back wall of the building to the NW corner to Room 168, the County Clerk's Office.  First you must get in line to take a number to wait in line.  Asinine, I know, but remain focused!  There is a velvet rope leading up to the office entrance.  Stand in that line behind the black floor line.  The other people bypassing you are responding to their numbers being called.  Upon entering the County Clerk's Office, show them your paperwork from the Tax Collector, take a number, and wait outside the office.  Once your number is called, you go back inside and pay your fee for registering your Fictitious Business Name with cash (in person), debit card, money order, cashier's check, or personal check.  They will give you a receipt and instruct you on how to publish it.  (I went with The Recorder - $44 total for publishing your FBN once a week for four consecutive weeks and they file completion with the County Clerk's Office for you and send you confirmation for everything.),So, what did we learn from this trip?  Go mid-day (weird, I know), mid-week.  Ask someone if you are in the right place before standing in a long line - it could be the wrong one!  Have your paperwork completed in advance.  Check, cash or money order will get you paid and on your way.  And be grateful you can pursue a business you LOVE!"
A great place to elope!  We had a beautifully simple elopement here on Friday.  What a great back drop to our special day!!   YIPPEE!
"Great selection of books. The library indeed is gigantic as other reviewers mentioned. Although I didn't spend time studying in this library, I feel like it might be a great study spot as it is quiet, clean and spacious. A huge plus for access to outlets almost everywhere in the library. They have computers everywhere as well so it's not hard at all to locate the books you are looking for.,1 star deduction for dirty bathrooms.... I think they have the most disgusting bathrooms ever. Just really hope they clean frequently and maintain them well. Bathrooms are IMPORTANT!!!!"
"As of Feb 13, my new husband and I are HUGE fans.  We had a very spur of the moment wedding at City Hall and it was fabulous.  The rotunda was unreal and the ceremony was extremely special.,As for the spur-of-the-moment bit, we're leaving our lovely SF and moving to Boston.  So we wanted to send ourselves off as a married team instead of two singletons.,Like many other reviews said, if you're looking to get married in the most beautiful surroundings for a small fee - nothing beats SF City Hall."
"This is a review of the building, not the collection.,We went on a tour of the LAPL this afternoon.  It leaves the book shop every afternoon at 12:30 and is lead by a docent. ,I wish I could remember the name of the lovely woman who took us around.  She was so proud of he library.,Here's the deal:  built in 1927.  The original building is concrete.  All those murals and painted ceilings?  They're painted right on the cement.,Fire (arson) in the 1980s.  A bond referendum was passed to rebuilt, repair, and clean the original building and add a huge new wing.  ,It's fabulous.  The central atrium of the old building.  The children's library.  The atrium of the new building.  The artwork.  ()The chandeliers in the new atrium are great.  I also loved the art in the elevators made from cards out of the old card catalogues.),There's more I've forgotten.,Trust me on this.  Do the 20 minute tour.  It will make you want to go back for more."
"My hubby and I recently had our dream wedding at San Francisco City Hall.  When I say dream wedding, I truly mean it. For 1 day, I felt like a real princess.  Our wedding was PERFECT, and it wasn't over the top with florals or extensive decor. Why? Simply because SF City Hall doesn't need it.,We rented out SF City Hall for Saturday, 09.10.11.  Due to the 'specialty' date, as referred to by many of our vendors, we rented it out far in advance. I suggest you do the same if you decide to host your wedding here.  You can place a 'hold' without a deposit and if anyone else wants to book your date, City Hall will call you and give you the option of submitting a deposit or letting go of the hold. (FYI - the deposit is 75% of total rental fee and must be paid in Cash or Check),We explored many different beautiful options like the Asian Art Museum, Ritz Carlton, Bently Reserve, Cavallo Point, The Fairmont, Four Seasons, StoneTree Golf Club, Flood Mansion, Omni Hotel, Sir Francis Drake Hotel, Julia Morgan Ballroom, de Young Museum, etc. ,The moment we walked into SF City Hall both of our jaws dropped and we knew it was the place for us.  We were immediately wowed by the marble floors, intricate details in architecture, and the grand stairway of the rotunda.  I instantly pictured our wedding ceremony, seating, tables for our reception, and all the beautiful Tiffany Blue accents our day would bring.,Our wedding started at 5:30pm sharp with a 30-minute ceremony at the rotunda.  After the ceremony, guests were escorted to the Mayor's Balcony for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres.  During the cocktail reception, our caterer and wedding coordinator teamed up to change the ceremony decor to dinner tables.  Everything happened quickly and smoothly.  Around 7:15 guests were directed to the elevators and they made their way back down to the rotunda for dinner and dancing.  Our sweetheart table was placed on the platform of the grand staircase.  We had an amazing view of all tables and all of our guests had a clear view of us.  I hate it when I go to weddings and I can't see what's happening due to the poor layout of the venue.  This was certainly not the case at SF City Hall.  Plus, the beautiful interior made a spectacular backdrop for photos.,We had a photo booth near the South Light Court.  It was a great location to keep away from the aesthetics of the wedding celebration but easy for guests to stumble to after several cocktails.  Our all-night Open Bar was a big hit! =P,I will warn you that City Hall is extremely uptight with events.  At our initial meeting, prior to putting down a deposit, we were told that they're more laid back than other venues. (ie. Asian Art Museum - even more strict than SF City Hall)  SF City Hall was not laid back at all and several issues came up as we got closer to the wedding date.  I completely understand because it is a government building.  They have to abide by different regulations than a typical hotel or restaurant but it would have been nice to hear all of this from the get go rather than a surprise with only a couple weeks to go.  They require an ALL VENDORS site visit where they'll basically tell everyone the do's and don'ts of the venue.  They also have to PRE-APPROVE several factors of your event.  We received many preliminary approvals but had to go through it again 2 weeks prior to the wedding. In our case it was Unity Candles (used during the ceremony), kneeling bench (used during the ceremony), photo booth placement, loose diamond decor on tables, votives, and a few other things.  It surprised me that they were really strict w/our wedding only because they've allowed New Year's Eve parties and raves.  How could our small wedding even compare to the madness of these events?  ,SF City Hall requires that SF Police and the Fire Marshall are present the entire time so that's another big expense, on top of the rental fee.  Insurance is also required and you can purchase through City Hall but if you do your research like we did, you can save some $.  We obtained the same insurance for 1/3 of what they charged.,Our wedding concluded at midnight.  It was beyond beautiful and our guests had a fabulous time.  Many of them said it was the best wedding they had ever been to and I agree, though I am biased. ;)  ,If you're tight on $$$, SF City Hall also has an affordable wedding package for only $4,000 for a 2-hour rental."
"There is absolutely nothing I can possibly say that would do Fenway Park justice, it would be an epic understatement of the awe and lore this majestic ball park offers every single visitor..."
"I have driven around, parked out in front, and stood at the gate of this historic stadium, but have yet to actually walk inside.(long story that does not involve law enforcement). ,Having grown up in New York, and spending some time at the original Yankee Stadium, I have an appreciation for older ball parks.,I hope to see an actual game here someday, but will at least take the tour in the next few years when my daughter is a little older."
"Sweet Caroline, the Green Monster, Pesky's pole, Ted William's red seat and the Citgo sign--Fenway is a baseball temple.  There are only two parks remaining in baseball that house new games and have a catalog of historic baseball moments--Wrigley and Fenway.  And Fenway is filled to the brim with memories.,Renovations to the stadium in the 21st century have made Fenway not just historic, but a great place to watch a game.  The seating is more comfortable and the old blocked sight lines are gone.  And the seats in the bleachers and along the baselines feel very close to the action.  It's without a doubt one of the best ballparks in baseball (even if a Fenway Frank is just a hot dog in a piece of Wonder bread)."
"The California Supreme Court has posted on its walls a lot of pictures of  other cities' City Halls and I've got to say that San Francisco's is the most beautiful of them all.  When you stand in the rotunda and look up, you're looking up at some amazing work in the dome. ,I also had the opportunity to go inside the Mayor's Office when he was out of town one week, and the wood paneling, his desk, the entire office was just gorgeous.  The other offices and rooms there are pretty nice, too.  ,The only reason why I can't give it five stars is because I had my prom here and I attended another banquet here, and the acoustics are just awful. Seriously, do not rent this place if you ever hold an event that requires audio.  Oh, and I like how City Hall's exterior can be lit up in different colors, but I hate it when they do red.  When the outside is lit up in the red, it truly looks like City Hall is the doorway to hell."
"As part of American history of Independence, a must see for young and old alike. Honestly, the place made me feel certainly more patriotic. Tickets required to enter the hall.,If you ever look closely at the reverse of  old and new hundred dollar bills, you will recognize this building. Look for the historic marker where Abraham Lincoln stood, right at the foot of the statue of George Washington.,Right across the street if the free Philadelphia Liberty Bell exhibit. You've gotta make this stop. There is an entire hall devoted to the bell alone. ,Further down the street is is the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Also interesting:  if you've ever collected the State quarters, this site produced 50 of them and the rest were minted in Denver."
"Greatest stadium in baseball?,Yes and no.,Yes for the green grass, the green monster, awesome views, provided you dont sit in from of the obstructing bars, the fan friendly seating (sit anywhere you like as long as someone isnt sitting there) the food (Italian sausage) and the legendary Boston Red Sox. The true house that Ruth Built.,No for the seats. It's not a myth. They really are as bad as you have heard. Very cramped and uncomfortable benches.....my only salvation was that nobody was sitting in the seats next to me and I could stretch out a little.....If it werent for that this place would be the tops.,I recommend the bleaches in the outfield. Newer sears and cheaper prices."
"I Love taking in a baseball game when im out on the road.  These old stadiums are amazing, they just reek the spirit of baseball, you can smell it, you can taste it.  Its a really hard feeling to describe, you just gotta see for yourself.  Dont forget your ice cold Sam Adams and a Hot dogg to make it the right experience!!"
"As a die hard Yankee fan, it pains me to admit this but Fenway Park is one of the best ballparks I've ever been to. Ignoring the fact that I despise the team that plays here, it's hard to find any negatives with Fenway Park.,I love old school ballparks and sadly there aren't too many left. Fenway is the cream of the crop. I liked it better than Wrigley. When you enter this ballpark, you really feel like you're stepping back in time.,I like to get here early because the atmosphere is always a lot of fun. There's a ton of bars around the area and they close off the street before games. ,Both times I've been here was for Yankees/Red Sox games. Despite being decked out in head to toe Yankee gear, the fans were friendly for the most part*. I could attribute this to being a girl and both times I came here was with another female. But I didn't really see any of the Yankee fans, males included, getting bothered. ,This ballpark is a must see for every baseball fan! It's impossible not to fall in love with this place. ,_____________________________________________________,*There was one guy who yelled at me, ""Jeter swallows"" when I walked past him in my Jeter jersey. Now normally I would just think, ""Hardy, har, har. He's not being serious. Just a Red Sox fan teasing me cause I root for the better team."" But no. He was dead serious and based on the look he gave me, you would think I killed his cat. I was about to give him a, ""Well he learns from your mom"" but thought better of it. I'm pretty sure this guy would have given me a Snookie-esque punch in the face. There are plenty of life lessons I want to learn but knowing what it feels like to have a dude punch me in the face is not one of them."
"I was reading the reviews of Fenway and it dawned on me what the draw is on this ballpark.,Let me start from the beginning.  I am not a huge baseball fan and I live in Los Angeles....keep reading it gets better.  I have gone to Dodgers Stadium and Angels Stadium and they are...ballparks...fine have a Dodger dog drink some beer and oh yeah the game...watch the game.,I have been to Chase Field in Phoenix and that is super cool with retractable roof, restaurant seating where you can watch the game and a swimming pool in the outfield....nice..oh yeah and the game.,Boston On Game Day:,I don't care where you are in their subway, at restaurants at the pubs and miles from Fenway EVERYONE is in their Red Sox gear.  About 4 hours before game time we took the subway or the T or whatever you call it and headed toward Fenway.  On the subway I swear there was not one person with out Red Sox gear there.  I know what they were thinking...damn tourist. ,Anyways...I said to my bf and my son are all these people headed to the game?  I found out quickly that they weren't because they were getting off at all the stops.  We get to the area and pop in one of the bars to hang out until the gates open and of course everyone has their gear on.,Gates open which for those that haven't been is on the street so when you give them your ticket you are not in the stadium but in the street next to the stadium and there are beer stands and souvenir stands and the party begins.,Cut to game time:,My tickets were near 3rd base and about 15 rows up so we had good seats.  I always heard about the Green Monster and now I know what it is.  The stadium is kind of old school with the score board that is not digital but like metal plates that change.  The energy in the stadium is amazing.  I even got excited about the game.  There is a constant buzz to the place like the stadium has some kind of hidden drug that keeps you alert and focused.,Why did I write about my subway trip and all?  Because that is where the energy begins.  It begins with the excitement of going to the game and the energy is brought to the stadium.  Honestly, the stadium is nice but it is the energy in the stadium that  makes it sooooo cool.,BTW Red Sox beat the Texas Rangers...I HATE TEXAS and it was the year the Red Sox won the World Series.  ,Not a bad first time experience.  I have a pink Red Sox baseball cap that I can now wear when traveling to the game...maybe I don't look like such a tourist now....yeah pink...maybe I still do."
"Coming here was very strange for me.  Back home, my family has season tickets to a monstrous concrete stadium surrounded by a giant parking lot and flanked by an 8 lane freeway.,I walked by Fenway Park a few times a month for the better part of a year and had no idea it was there.  Then when I did finally enter to watch my home team kick some Red Sox butt, I was surprised by the grittiness and honesty that I saw.  This park is crowded, the ground is uneven, the bleachers hang low over your head, and it's a beautiful way to experience a baseball game.   It's gritty and old-fashioned.  It brings to mind a certain song from a musical that I won't mention...  All the vendors have great Bah-ston accents.,You can bet I yelled along to Sweet Caroline and even felt just a tiny twinge of regret when the Red Sox lost and the fans poured out of the stadium dejected.,It was only a tiny twinge..."
"I have to love Fenway, being a red-blooded New Englander.,I wish I could cuddle with Fenway every night before going to sleep.,When going to Fenway, there is only one type of bad seat in the house, and it is the one behind the pole that holds up an upper deck.,Obviously, everything is more expensive at Fenway, but you don't come here for cheap eats or souvenirs. If you like baseball, it is definitely worth every single penny to buy a ticket to a Sox game and enjoy the country's oldest ball park. Built in 1912, and kept up since, you can just smell the history that is present in this amazing park. The fan energy is amazing, and you always realize Boston is smaller than you ever knew. Everyone is a friend of a friend of a friend, or frequents the restaurant you work at. ,Nothing feels more like Boston than Fenway."
Fenway Park needs no review.
Fenway is awesome but why did they have to change the frank?!?!
"Beautiful building representative of our city.,-Amazing architecture: beautiful exterior and interior with some questionable characters around,-Sometimes it's scruffy on the outside but definitely cleans up well,-A little high maintenance, but it's historically significant,-Very photogenic and classy; especially in everyone's wedding photos,And despite minor flaws, I think my City Hall is better than yours."
"I love this place. I want to grow vegetables all around it so the people in need can eat corn, tomatoes, basil, potatoes, beans, cabbage, lettuce, chili peppers, tomatillos, and strawberries for free, outside the library in peace. Just bring some bread."
This a huge library they have about three floors and i love how they have catagories of books seperated in each floor and i do like that they have a food court so when you get hungry you can have some chinese food or a sandwich and some salad.
"Visited two years ago. Wanted to make sure I posted a 5 star review. Amazing ballpark. ,I wore Angels gear and cheered on my Angels in Fenway Park, and I didn't get mugged or killed. I wasn't being obnoxious so I guess they let me cheer the Angels when they scored runs, or maybe they knew they would sweep us in the playoffs. Either way it was a great experience, and the crows was great. ,If you are coming from Los Angeles, just imagine a legendary ballpark like Dodger's stadium, that is clean and upgraded like Angels' Stadium. Also rabid fans like Dodger Fans, but non-violent like Angel Fans. ,Feels very secure when you leave, plenty of light. I've been to the old Yankees stadium, and when you leave after a game you feel like you are walking into scary darkness."
"I'm a Sox fan, so I think that the Baseball Gods would open up and give me a perm if I gave Fenway anything other than a ""5 star"".... ,Having said that, Fenway still deserves it... ,I've been to Safeco, Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium, the old Tropicana Fields, LA Coliseum, Shea (RIP baby), and Qualcomm.... I've sat in box seats behind home plate, bleacher seats, 1st baseline seats, pavilion seats, and stood for hours watching a game. This is excluding the dozens of bars I've been to during the course of catching a game... in all of those venues, not a one could compare with Fenway in terms of atmosphere, food service, and ""feeling"". ,The atmosphere of Fenway is one big, REALLY big party. There's just something odd about walking in the middle of Boston and seeing whole streets closed off so that people can walk into the park. No one really tries to drive around the park when there's a game, and even if you AREN'T a fan, you simply cannot escape the atmosphere during the baseball season. There are old wooden seats, and new pavilion ones with attendants that bring whatever you order in minutes. There's a lady that swings by the Ted Williams statue and rubs it for good luck on her daily run. There's Yawkey Way where the team store literally takes up a whole block! It's what the stadium of a city full or rabid fans SHOULD be like, with all of the attendant tradition mixed with improvements... ,The food is grades better than many of the other stadiums also. Chowder (naturally) is from Legal Seafood, the Fenway Monster dogs are grilled and absolutely perfect, and the Lobster Roll is amazing! Plus souvenir cups are REALLY cups, not some cheap plastic that many other venues issue out... ,There's also nothing like seeing the Green Monster live for the first time, and the fame Pesky and Fisk poles... the weirdly shaped dimensions of the field lend to the whole ""old school"" feeling that Fenway gives off... Not to mention the scoreboard, changed by hand during games. ,*sigh*... if you go to no other stadium, you should go to Fenway... and not just because I'm a Sox fan."
"As a landmark, this is a beautiful place to visit for tourists, and I've heard people also prefer this for weddings (cheaper venue yet still beautiful). For special events they'll light up the hall with beautiful colors (as you can see in the photos). I happened to pass by on the 75th Anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge and it was all lit up in international orange. :)"
"It converted a life long Spanish futbol aficionado into a die hard baseball fan.  I mean, 3 yrs in Ohio, 4 in Philly, and he didn't give a crap about baseball.  One trip to Fenway, and we've got a fan for life!,So. Much. Fun."
"Even though I live two blocks from the Baldwin Hills branch, I always make the trip to the central library. This is an amazing place. The architecture, the books and the staff make this library one of the best I've ever been inside of. ,The staff here are always very helpful. The selection is absolutely gigantic. I come here at least twice a month. This branch is only two blocks walking distance from the 7th/Metro sub station. I take the Expo line here every time!,This library is something Los Angeles can be proud of."
"Our City Hall's dome was inspired by Mansart's Baroque dome of Les Invalides, Paris, and is the fifth largest dome in the world. It's a huge building and gorgeous inside. Civic offices never had it so good"
"Stopped by here on accident.  Got off the bus to make a transfer and was like whoa, what's this gold building?,Oh...It's city hall!!!,Must be nice to be in a city where gold was found, everything is blinging!"
Beautiful setting for an event! Been to a wedding and my company Holiday party. Both were spectacular!!
"A library is sort of a harem for a person's who has an insatiable appetite for knowledge.  ,The central library is this city's treasure.  From the grounds to the ceilings, this place has something for everyone.  It is such a shame though, that it is highly under-utilized.  ,I know that in our digitized world, the library as we know it will become a vestige of an eden of knowledge.  But, there's something about physically going through the book stacks in search of a new publication or an old reliable standby."
"Breathtaking! I drive by this place every day on the way home, and every time I take it in and thank my lucky stars that I still live in this amazing city. Truly a landmark building.,But you've not seen it in it's real glory until you've seen the SF Symphony performing on the steps inside the rotunda for the Black & White Ball, and waltzers in dapper tuxedos and beautiful gowns giving the place real class. Now THAT was a good memory. :)"
"I must admit - the last time I was here it is because my 12th grade English teacher forced me to come. I've never been a fan of libraries - and now I wonder ""why?!"",I bet I looked like an idiot as I was walking around with my jaw dropped admiring all of the artwork and the multi-level facility. Artwork!? I never knew libraries had artwork. The libraries of my childhood were dark, musty smelling, and often had weird looking people browsing questionable websites at the computer station. This library is NOTHING like that! ,I didn't browse too much - but I did find a book I needed in the Teenspace section. I felt like quiet a rebel - 22 and hanging out in the kids section. ""These tables are for kids only!"" yeah......screw you sign - but hey, I was working on a school project, so that made it okay right? I liked the fact that Teenspace was away from the rest of the library and you could talk like normal individuals in there. They even had a big screen TV in there - apparently if there's not classes you can ask the librarian for the remote and watch a movie. Pretty sweet! ,There's also a store in the library, and I even saw a sign for ice cream and Panda Express. They have events (knitting, speakers, documentaries, etc) for all ages and I love the fact that rich or poor - people in business suits and people who were obviously homeless could hang out here and enjoy all the beauty."
"I got married here last week and it was fantastic. ,The instructions on the website were very clear, and prepared us well for our license and ceremony appointments. We booked our appointments online with ease about a week in advance, and plenty of appointments were available. On the ""big day"", we both used passports as ID and didn't need any other paperwork. Our license appointment was all finished in just 15 minutes, and we went off to get ready for our ceremony. We left a 2 hour gap between our appointments, and I was glad to have that time to do my makeup and change clothes. ,The ceremony was wonderful. Those with negative stereotypes/preconceptions about city hall weddings should definitely leave them at the door! Our officiant, Valerie Walker, was so kind. The introduction and vows she gave were very beautiful, and she seemed so warm and so genuinely happy for us. We had one witness, a good friend who also took pictures for us. A *lot* of tourists took pictures of us from the edge of the rotunda, but they didn't bother us at all -- the ceremony still felt wonderfully intimate and happy, and they all clapped for us when we kissed, which was sweet. The ceremony lasted only about ten minutes, but was very meaningful and memorable."
"Regardless of your fandom, there's no denying that Fenway Park is tradition, an experience and a great time.  It's one of America's oldest ballparks and that alone makes it cool (or maybe that's just the history buff in me that thinks so).  But more than that, when you're at a game at Fenway, you can look around and see what a special place it is.  Rowdy fans, Fenway Franks, the Green Monster, singing Sweet Caroline, Pesky's pole, dads with their sons, friends with their beers, legendary retired numbers, homemade kettle corn, people chanting Yankees suck no matter whom the Sox are playing, the longest home run ever hit  - tradition.  Definitely make a point to see a game at some point in your life - you won't forget it."
"You have not been to Boston until you've been to Fenway. I don't even like baseball, but Fenway made me see the light. ,The bleacher seats are the place to be. Fans embrace all things there are to love about Boston: the passion, the pride, and of course, the profanity....,Best piece of advice: Get the Primo Sausage. That's a sausage you simply can't resist...,One warning, the Alcohol Compliance team operate one of the strictest liquor lockdowns I've ever seen. If innings run long, they will shut all the alcohol booths (even if your arm is about to reach for a beer just poured for you) as soon as a certain time limit is hit. So, naturally, drink heavy early & often."
"This is a fantastic ballpark. Definitely in my top three. That being said, AT&T Park is the best ballpark in America. Go Giants!"
"We were here tonight for a party hosted by the Bedford St Martin's publishing company. To get in we had to go through a metal detector, but the sheriff's deputies were very nice about it (almost to a fault since my friend went through, it beeped at her, and he sent her along). We had some mexican mole and Chinese potstickers. They only had domestic beers and the place was hot, but there were probably 300+ people in the large main area. An impressive place to have a party, but after about an hour, they were trying to send us on our way. No fun. We headed to a local bar instead. Nice building, average party/reception."
"It was the last tour of the day, but still very knowledgable tour guide ~ delightful visit."
"I know this is a very famous stadium with history but....,from where we were seated in the outfield, for the first 7 innings I could literally see nothing but the outfield. The way the seats are set up, there were just too many other people blocking my view. It wasn't until inning 7, when many ppl decided to head out early, that I was finally able to see and enjoy the game.,It was a great and entertaining game though. and now I know that if I should ever come back, those were the wrong seats to purchase."
"Everyone should go to Church, enough said...,Amen~,Red Sox Rock!"
Awesome stadium. Too bad baseball has become so boring.
"Been coming here for 20+ years. It's really great to visit because of the history but it's small and kind of a grimey dump. They got their 100 years out of it so it's time to reward the fans and build a proper facility. The staff is generally pretty nice and the food is decent, but with any stadium not worth the price. The ownership group have made amazing upgrades and bettered the experience for all but the cutesy feel is getting old. Parking is an absolute sham in the area. $40 for a game in may? Unreal. I love the sox but avoid going to Fenway because of the trip into Boston and parking."
"If you are a baseball fan (and you most likely are seeing that you are reading this) Fenway park IS as good as it gets. I am not going to tell anything you do not know here. It is not one of the new mega stadiums. It is an old fashioned park with many of the new amenities. Good food stands, good crodw flow, close to mass transit and to other food venues. My seats were OK but it was a great time. Take the tour at some point if you can. ,If you are Not a true true baseball fan, I would still suggest the experience if you go with some friends that enjoy the game. there is decent food, a good crow, and you have little kids they will enjoy it. you can try the no alcohol section.   There is plenty of security, so it feels safe, and lots of families.,If you do not like baseball it may be a stretch unless you get the seat for free or really like the people going with you and it's not about the game.  You will probably have fun if you have an open mind!.  But then again, if you are not a baseball fan, you are probably not reading this :-),The fact that the ballpark is easily accessible by mass transit is a huge plus.  Get off at the Kenmore stop, it's closer."
"Ahh Fenway Pahk.  Its a wicked pissah of a place to watch some baseball.,My first trip to the Paak was aftah my eleventh birthday when my ma and dad took me to see the Sawx play Cal Ripken and the fahckin' Orioles.  As a young adult from New Hampsha I was moah than happy to see Wade Boggs, Dwight Evans and Greenwell kick some fahckin Oriole ayss.,And through the yeahs having a chance to see so many Sawx stahs... that's a whole notha story.,In all awnesty though, I cahn't say that Fenway is the best old ballpahk - that would have to be Wrigley in Chicager.  But Fenway's cornahs, the Pesky Pole, and Green Monstah make it a worthwhile trip, no which gawd damn team you root foah."
"Fenway is not only a classic ballpark, but it has a lot going for it.,*  Old classic park - bonus,*  Situated in downtown for walkability and barhopping before/after game,*  Near a ""T"" transit for public commute,*  Small capacity stadium, so always a sellout,*  Fans are fanatical.... they love their team and cheer the entire game,*  Songs after victory.... and Sweet Caroline.... very unique and cool,Negatives - expensive seat no matter which night of the week."
"I have been a Red Sox fan for years (Cubs are my no. 1 team) and I finally was able to homage to the Green Monster this summer. It was so great to see this iconic stadium in the green paint! People were friendly, services were plenty and food was great. Nothing like seeing a sea of red throughout the whole place.,For being one of the 2 remaining original parks, Boston has done a great job of keeping a clean, classic-looking but updated facility. The classic signage and openness was great. A true temple to the game. ,If you are in Boston, whether you like baseball or not, you should catch a game. Even if you can't get into the game there a plenty of great bars and restaurants steps from the park much like Wrigleyville in Chicago.,GO SOX!"
"I've never been to a baseball park like this. I am not from Boston but I am a Red Sox fan, and this place really has character, like a life of it's own, and it's not just the history. The fans are all very cool, friendly, and interactive with the game. We saw the Red Sox vs. A's and unfortunately the A's won, but it was still a good time. If I have any complaints it's that the staff clears out the park promptly after the game; we thought it would be a cool idea to check out the new Green Monster seats but were foiled by a staff member who insisted we were going the wrong way. Wrong, we knew where we wanted to go. If I can ever find my way back here I will happily return."
"Fun if you're a tourist.  If you come in here for business, you'll be here all day as the offices tell you to stand in one line, then the other, then back to the first.  Lost a whole day off productivity because people in the office can't correctly provide firms that the office across the hall needs.  Take three days off your business to get all the paperwork done to open your business.,Really annoying, get a supervisor to train offices next to each other what paperwork the other needs.,Fictitious name comes after business license, it just doesn't say so on state or city website.  The firm in question just literally was a woman writing my name in a firm to take office #2."
"Aside from the stunning architecture, the ideal location smack dab in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles, and historical richness of Central Library is its fantastic book collection. Seriously, I can read about an obscure book in the morning, and by the afternoon I have it in my possession, at least temporarily. Now, Central Library can be intimidating simply for the size, but the information desk has some maps of the place that can assist you in locating the section you seek, and then after that it's just good old Dewey Decimal. Take some time to savor this place. Visit the children's section and take in the stunning rotunda before you do. Walk around the shaded outside. Bask in the wonder of being able to find almost any book imaginable. Central Library is a true gem for those of us in Downtown Los Angeles who take the time to appreciate it."
"Very historical, perfect ending to our visit to Boston!  It helped that we had excellent seats, with a lot of room and not a ton of crazed Boston fans around us.  We sat way up under the huge budweiser neon sign."
"A very beautiful historic ballpark. The only cons are paying $55 behind home plate and getting a obstructed view and having no leg room. A plus is not dealing with the annoying west coast bandwagon fans.,Go Angels!"
"I could go on and on about how magnificent this building appears, especially when glimpsed from exiting from the BART station, but you just need to see it for yourself.,City Hall was fake ""burned"" during Roger Moore's ""View to a Kill"" bond.  SF was extremely cooperative with a bunch of stunts and shooting locales for the movie."
"Good news, now I can say that I went to Fenway park, bad news, seats are very tight, prices on everything is very high, the park is very outdated, very old, unimpressed."
"What an awesome ballpark! I take my Dad to a different ballpark each year - we are in year 11 - and Fenway is in my Top 2! The experience is incredible - you can feel the excitement as you get near the stadium with the crowds of people and bars all around. ,The stadium is very historic and over 100 years old. They do a great job of showing this history everywhere within the concourses and the field itself - aka Pesky Pole, Green Monster, etc..... ,The food is everywhere and a great variety - so not much waiting in line. Also, many different beer vendors to choose from - so again, no waiting in line. ,We were there for a Friday and Saturday game. The fans around us could not have been any nicer - they could tell from our southern slang that we were not from the Boston area! They explained where the best beer area's were (local beers) as well as the different idiosyncrasies about the park. ,Great park, great fans and a great time for sure."
"I love City Hall. ,It was at its front steps that I watch my friend get married when Gavin allowed gay marriages and I've never seen so many gay couples, except maybe Pride...or Holloween...or Folsom, um, let's start over. I've never seen so many loving gay couples wanting to get married in my life. On that fateful day, I clasped my hands together praying that one day I was going to meet the man of my dreams. And, I swear, it was at that moment a black tinted car drove up the curb and out pops Gavin, our mayor! Under the beautiful, sunny sky and gleaming City Hall dome, he flashes his charismatic smile and shakes my hand (he had hands as soft as Chinese silk, btw). I was stunned by the moment and all I could stutter was, 'Thank you, Mr Mayor, for allowing love to prevail.' I'll never forget that day - it was a perfect day, even if I didn't get hitched.,Inside is the grand staircase where I witnessed the SF Boys Chorus sing like angels at the Mayor's inauguration, before being whisked off to sing for Prez Obama. Well, I guess if you can sing like angels the Heavens will open...or something like that. ,On the 4th floor are hearing rooms where the different Commissions go about their business and the public gets their opportunity to voice their issues on public record (cameras are pointed at the podium and the Commissioners' bench which can be viewed on SFgov TV, Channel 26). I love the balconies on the 4th floor with the giant arched windows to let the sun flow in and the giant French-style urns that ornate the rail. This is the location for the filming of 'Milk' with Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. ,On the 2nd floor, you can find the individual Supervisor's office with their names emblazoned on the doors.  I like passing by Supe Bevan Dufty's door - such a nice guy and I think, overall, he is good for City gov't.  The top of the grand staircase leads you to the double doors into the Board of Supervisor's hearing chambers; the walls are made of a rare Manchurian oak. On the opposite end is Rm 200, the Mayor's office. ,The first floor you'll find the Tax Collector, Neighborhood Services, Assessor-Recorder's offices.  I've seen some amazing transformations of City Hall for parties with golden trumpeting angels, luxe velvet draperies, dramatic lightings, in like 3 hours flat.  And there are tons of newly wed couples and their friends in some snappy clothes.  I love seeing their beaming faces, one of which was Marilyn's, decades ago.  Maybe one day I'll even see Toni Collette having her 'Muriel's Wedding' moment, or some version of it, with the quintessential ABBA music running through my head.,Don't forget the basement.  It's not what you think.  They actually treat their walls here like a gallery and display incredible things like Billy Graham's concert collection of photos (Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Cure) and various other up-and-coming artists - provocative.  Currently, they have these giant photos of offices with office workers.  I won't bore you with my interpretations, but it does have visual impact.,I believe City Hall is most beautiful at night, with its dome and columns all lit up - a very stately building. The dome is an echo of Les Invalides in Paris (Napoleon's burial site). The exterior is Sierra granite and much of the interior is California marble and Indiana sandstone. The building is in the Beaux Arts ('fine art') style, similar to the other buildings that collectively make up the Civic Center Historic District with the park in the center (they now have outdoor cafes to enjoy the sun). Across the park is the Asian Art Museum and the Main Library, and along McAllister is the California Supreme Court, where they ruled the validity of Prop 8. ,5 stars to City Hall for being a significant part of a world-class city!"
"It's way more fun to write/read bad reviews, so I apologize for another positive review in my review stable.,Here's what's great:,-They have great free shows.  The Frank Lloyd Wright show, for instance, was really interesting and well done.  And it was totally free. ,-It's a beautiful building, inside and out, especially the gallery spaces,-I've never gotten off my ass to go to one of their lectures, but they have really cool guests, mostly high-brow stuff but interesting-looking nonetheless. ,-The gift shop is amazing.  If you ever need a gift or a card or something, please check out their gift shop.  They feature handmade items as well as inventive toys, jewelry etc.,-Nice and cool inside on a hot day.,-The city got it's shit together and the library is open on Mondays again.  ,-Oh yeah, books.,Here's what's not,-The grumpy hobos that move in and stink up the joint.  Oh, I'm sorry, was that insensitive?  ,Lots more positives than negatives.  If you don't like reading, they have dvds. ,One last thing.  SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
"What a gorgeous venue! For a morning ceremony, this gorgeous landmark can be yours for only $4,000!!  It's a 2-hour package, but you can add on additional hours for a small fee."
"This place is HUGE! I almost got lost. The staff is extremely helpful and answered all of my questions with a smile!,HOWEVER, this place smells horrid, especially in the computer room. There seems to be alot if bums from skidrow inside of the library. Computer room smelled so bad that it made me cough nonstop. Sucks because this place has everything you need!"
How can I not be an amazing fan of city hall as it is where I got married to my wonderful wife!
"I stopped into City Hall yesterday to take care of a simple business chore and never would have guessed that it would launch such an affirming afternoon.,It was just one of those days where everything was going my way-- got a spot right in front, with a broken meter no less.  The office I needed was easy to find and I didn't have to wait a second until I was being helped by someone polite and proficient.  The transaction took about 5 pleasant minutes from start to finish.  ,now for the truly life-affirming part... I had to go to the City Controller's office to register my business name.  This is the same office where people get marriage licenses and the small room is simply brimming with dreams and optimism.  The man opening up for  the restaurant that had clearly been a dream for years made me smile.  The couples- some dressed up for the big day, others seemingly walking in in what they woke up in, all exuded such excitement that it made me giddy.,And then! to emerge from this room-of-good-spirits to the architectural splendor of City Hall itself-- that dome! oh, that staircase!,seriously, I think anyone who finds themselves in the middle of a bummer of a day, should plant themselves at City Hall for a half-hour.  you'll be smiling in no time!"
"This review is not for the repository of books that this building contains but for the structure and grounds itself. Originally constructed in 1926 there have been renovations and additions over these many years but the structure as a whole retains a cohesive look and maintains that feeling of awe when you see it. ,Much more than a library, this is part of Los Angeles history and it's right there for you to explore, and it's free! Even if you don't have the time to enter and explore you can walk past the fountains, take a look at the World Peace Bell, or maybe sit on one of the shaded benches and have lunch. If you have the time walk the perimeter of the building and look at the architectural details before entering the building. Once inside there are many things to see, wonder around by yourself and explore or if you would rather the library has guided tours Monday - Friday 12:30 pm and Saturday 11:00 am & 2:00 pm. You can find out more about the tours at  the library website , . If you prefer you can download and print a self guided tour at "
"I'm writing this specifically for the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector Passport Service*  ,*This office is an authorized municipal passport acceptance office, not a federal agency or passport issuing facility. ,I was tipped off this this office-within-an-office by a friend originally from China, who has a lot of savvy regarding getting things done quickly!  Thank the Lord for this office!  Maybe I would have been better off going through Travel Document Systems, but this was really not that painful.  ,Everyone has different circumstances, but as a passport renewal person, you must have a money order or personal check, filled out 'in-person form', old passport, another form of ID, like license, and patience! ,It did take a while, because I had to leave to obtain a Money Order at US Bank on Van Ness ($6) and return, thus wasting my time and losing my place in line.  ,I recommend going earlier in the morning; you grab a number, WAIT, get your magical number called, process your paperwork with an employee, and then pay the cashier an additional $25 on top of the $135 expedited fee for a Will Call pick-up at the dreaded Passport agency on Hawthorne. ,I don't want to jinx it yet, but as far as needing to get a quick turn around on issuing a Passport, I'm glad I did it in the lovely atmosphere of City Hall, my first time in this building.  I can't wait for my trip to Australia!"
Fenway Park is the kind of ball park with history and mystique that defines American baseball. Came here to see the Orioles play the Red Sox when my sister was going to BU medical school.
"If ever you find yourself lucky enough to be in Boston, you should, if given the chance, go to Fenway Park. ,You should enjoy the full experience by starting outside and grabbing a sausage sandwich with onions and peppers served on an Italian roll. ,Or if you prefer, you can opt out and get the Fenway frank. (Although if you wait, you can get these little puppies inside at 2 for one).,Arrive a little early so you can walk around and appreciate the history you have come to be a part of. ,If you go in early Spring, be mindful of the weather, it will be windy and cold. If you are seeing an evening game, bring a coat and a blanket might be a good idea as well.,Then sit down and take a nice long look at the field, the green monster and the other fans who  live for their Red Sox.,I was thrilled to be there, and even though they were playing a team from my home state, you can bet that I was routing for the Sox. ,They won, and I was able to see a ball hit over the monster resulting in a grand slam!"
"I spend time in Boston and saw a game from the Red Sox.,It was awesome.,After the game we had some beer at Boston Beer Works. A nice place to be, but for a native of Cologne, Germany I was surprised from the Kolsch.,And Happe Birthday for the 100 anniversary of this old Ball Park!,Greetings from Cologne!"
"I went to get my domestic partnership here and things went great.  Easy to find and navigate, people were nice, and I was out of there in 20 mins!"
"So quick tip, it's totally worth it to get an online reservation and pay the convenience fee than it is to wait. Waiting in line to see ticket availability not only sucks but then you'll probably have to wait again for the tour to actually begin. Don't think of going to the Liberty in the interim because the line for that thing is literally down the block. Just pay the damn 3 bucks and save yourself the heartache.,The tour guides are all volunteers and know a lot-so basically it comes down to personality. One was really dry but had a lot of info the other (because Independence Hall is a campus of buildings) had a little more zip to him. Regardless, you're walking through the halls of the House of Representatives and the Senate-it's pretty crazy to think that at one point the Senate met in an attic somewhere but there you have it, 3 bucks to walk and breathe history."
"The EMC Club is an awesome place to see a game.  As expected, food and drink prices are outrageous!  John the bartender, (congratulations! Married 30 days...) was excellent.  In seat wait staff superb.  All around a great experience if you enjoy ""premium club"" type games."
"From California, and I've been to Fenway Park twice. Once for a baseball game, and the other to watch a hockey game at the Garden, and toured Fenway when it was covered in snow.  It's one of those parks you have to visit even if you're not a baseball fan, just because there's so much history involved.  Don't expect to be in a nice, comfortable seat to watch the game, as the seats are old (historic) and very, very small."
"My girlfriend and I came to New England for vacation and one of our first stops was to see the Red Sox at Fenway.  The park was old, and the charm was amazing.  People were friendly, seats had great views and the Sox won.  Easy access on the Green Line to Kenworth...then follow the crowd.  Recommended."
"Now this was a true experience if I do say so myself. ,On a first trip to Boston where's the first place a single dude who loves sports going to go.,If you guessed a bar, good guess but still wrong.,The man is going to Fenway that's where he's going! ,So after taking the green line T outbound to the Fenway stop, walking away from the station and feeling like I'm now almost in the 'burbs I start saying to myself ""Where the hell is the park, where the hell is the park"" ,Didn't help the fact that it started snowing on me either and I was looking like a real tourist jagoff wearing only a hoodie too....damn you California for spoiling me. ,""Oh hey a sign!"" I finally say to myself as I'm walking past an REI and Best Buy smorgasborad mall. ,Then I start getting real confused, all I see is hockey fans everywhere and some sort of parking lot tailgate party going with music BLASTING out onto the neighborhood. ,Now, to an outsider who's now freezing, thinking he's lost and damning his Iphone this just looked really out of place.,Until I pulled my head out of my ass and looked across the street at the.....gigantic.....green...monster. ,""Holy shit"" went though my mind, ""talk about an awkward place for a ball park"",I walked around the entire outside when finally curiousity kicked in and I asked someone what was with all the Hockey stuff.,""Winter classic brah"" says a guy drinking out of a Miller Lite can to me, ""You ain't from heeh are ya"".,No jackass, I'm not, I'm pretty sure only wearing a Hurley surf hoodie as an outer-garment would give it away. ,Anyway past the strange conversation... I walked up and tried to take a tour but, closed for the Holidays.....FML. ,""Maybe I could buy a nosebleed to this Winter Classic"" I thought. ,Yeah, NO...wasn't happening and I think about 30 Flyers fans with extra thick wallets and waistlines would either try to fight me for it or just flat out rob me blind in an ally way. ,Oh well, maybe next time."
"I'm a Cubs Fan through and through but had an opportunity to attend a game at Fenway Park.  Classic stadium wreaking of history.  The game was great, but the highlight was the fresh Italian sausage I had there!  MMMM Good!"
"It's the oldest ballpark in US baseball - can you seriously give it less than 5 stars?  We sat in right field, way up high in the bleachers, and we had a great view of the entire stadium (and the tickets were only about $20).  The Sox lost, which is no surprise this season, but it was fun.  ,If you buy a soda in the commemorative cup, you get free refills all night, which is a bonus.  Hot dogs are $5 - they are better if you get them from the guy walking around the stands than from one of the concession stands - at the concession stands, they are packaged early and after awhile the bun gets soft and gross.  ,Also they have elephant ears.  I can't remember the last time I had an elephant ear.  It was great!,It's a great place to see a game, and even if you don't like baseball it's a great way to spend some time outside in the open air.  Everyone should go at least once while they are in Boston."
"I'm a diehard Yankee fan, so coming here was a bit sacrilegious haha.,I definitely understand where all the hoopla surrounding this place comes from. This place has the same type of aura that the old Yankee Stadium had. Even though you Red Sox fans are the scum of the earth haha, you have a fine stadium over there. Hopefully they keep it around for years to come. ,FYI - Robbie Cano is a better 2B than Dustin Pedoria (I couldn't resist! haha)"
"more of a forest than a park in ""city park"" notion of the term, but a nice chunk of green plants in the middle of the city."
"I had attended a wedding this past weekend in San Francisco, and I was totally caught off guard at how beautiful this historical building was..........,When I heard the couple was going to get married at ""city hall"" and not at a church, all I thought of was a small, fly by night, let's get married quick, small rinky dink place..........little did I know how beautiful and grand this place was!,The building is quite old, but well kept.....it looks like something that was built a long time ago, and I could see someone saying - "":they don't make things like that anymore"".,The architecture of the building was definitely old school, there were large archways, and a stunning long staircase! This stunning landmark building probably has a long rich history, and I wished I took the time out to research this place before I came out here.,I came to City Hall  two days in a row, as the 1st day was spent attending the wedding rehearsal (for a few hours), and the 2nd day was for the wedding. On the 1st day I was there, it was like a zoo............so many couples getting married here, I could see various couples - man & wife..........and man & man.,I was a bit concerned as I was thinking, ""how is my family going to take any good photo's"" with so many strangers walking around using the same facilities? ,With so many people using this place, it would be a great distraction for a small and intimate wedding. ,Later I found out, you can actually rent out the entire facility to make it a private function, but of course it is not free.........for a fee, you can have the entire place for yourself...........this is what the couple did for their wedding day. All worth it, for the money spent! I tell you, this was one of the most memorable wedding ceremonies that I ever attended.,There is a large underground parking structure, for private functions, there is a flat fee of $15.00 for parking, otherwise it's by the hour for a fee.,I also found out that they do have tours of the facility, but the tours only happen on the weekdays.........I did not get a chance to tour the entire building, but if I ever get a chance to come back, I will surely take the tour of this grand place!"
"I love this library. The exterior and interior architecture is quite amazing, and I'm sure there is a lot of history the building. I typically come here to check out books, and if a book I want isn't available placing a hold from another branch is very easy and quick. The staff is friendly, and I've never found it too crowded. Great place to study, read, or explore."
"Some of the best times of my life have been spent here! There is no place in the world I would rather be. ,Yes, it is more expensive now and tickets are harder to get, but that just makes each visit that much more of an event. ,I have been to a few other ball parks and have yet to find one that comes close. (Wrigley, Yankee Stadium, Skydome, Camden Yards),Yankees Suck!,Go Sox!!"
"It pains me to say this, but I love Fenway Park.  As a Yankees fan living in San Francisco, I shouldn't praise this place, but I can't help it.,I've been to Fenway a couple of times, and I am going back in September of this year.  The last time I went there, in September 2004, Curt Schiling won his 20th game of the year against Tampa Bay Devil Rays.   (Remember the days when they sucked and used to be called ""Devil"" Rays?)  Anyway, the Red Sox were up 11-4 in the seventh, and not a single fan left.  Sure, they may have paid so much for the tickets, they felt like they were paying by the minute, but it's admirable nonetheless.  ,There are two things that I particularly like about Fenway Park.  First, its unique shape, design and its famous 1912 construction make me feel like an explorer: ""What is this little nook here?""  ""Have I been here before?""  Besides, like the Mrs. Winchester of Winchester Mystery House, the Red Sox owners never stop adding seats.  Why would they - every seat is a potential profit of a couple hundred bucks per game??  When I went to the game, I sat at one of those bar stools perched above the rest of the infield seats.  It was an amazing seat, about halfway between home and first.  For someone like myself, who brings a scorecard to every game, sitting at the ""desk"" at the game is priceless.,Second, (and this is particularly painful for me to admit), the most knowledgeable baseball fans in the country are in Boston.  Hands down.  Everyone I talked to at Fenway knew everything about everything baseball, not just the Red Sox.  It's truly amazing.  It's no surprise, since the very same people call WEEI after the game and ask the host: "" I don't understand why Timlin threw a fastball on a 3-2 count to a left-handed hitter, when he would have definitely chased a slider out of the strike zone.""  Now, those are real fans.,I'll be back in September.  I can't wait.  ,I still hate the Red Sox, though."
Love the history behind park
"How do you even begin to summarize Fenway Park?  The place is legendary. The Green Monster.  Pesky's Pole.  Fenway Franks.  The Sox.,Growing up in New England, and having family friends with season tickets, I've been lucky enough to attend a few games.  No matter where I've sat, it's been awesome, and worth every penny--because no matter where you are, you're surrounded by the atmosphere of Fenway.,It's a surreal experience and hard to describe to anyone who hasn't seen a game there.  You're essentially walking into a time capsule for America's past-time.  I'm always moved by this overwhelming sense of nostalgia, of pride, of some collective history.  There's nothing quite like it, and something I've never experienced at any other ballpark.,And I can't say why.  It's all very strange, feeling such a strong connection to a place you've only been to a handful of times.  But that's part of the charm of Fenway Park.,That, and you get to scarf down a Fenway Frank, or two.  And see, what is in my humble opinion, the best baseball franchise ever--the Boston Red Sox.   I really don't know what else to say."

"My wife and I were married here in the Rotunda.  Why wouldn't I love this place.  City Hall will always have a special place in my heart.  ,I just hope the California Supreme Court will give us back our constitutional right and keep SF City Hall a reminder of our special day.  ,Stop the H8!"
This place is huge! It's the equivalent of a mall for books. Of course you can only check out the books mostly but they do have a store with a small selection of books you can buy. ALSO they have a cafeteria you can go to when start getting hungry.
An amazing example of a grand builing in the beaux arts style of France.  Amazingly represents the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.  I look at this building every day as I wait go the GGT Bus # 10 on my way to work in Sausalito...It's a beautiful and very important structure in our city...
"Beautiful, great and amazing!,Not much more to say!"
"We got married here, and had a fabulous experience. Everyone we dealt with, from top to bottom, was so wonderful and easy to work with during the entire experience. It goes without saying that the venue was beautiful. A must see if you come to San Francisco."
"This place is gorgeous and huge. Oh, and filled with every book you can imagine. I'm an engineer and needed some study guides (which are super expensive). One day it occurred to me...""you work right by the library; maybe they have what you need."" I was right. I saved hundreds of dollars by borrowing the books.,The staff was also extremely friendly! Helped me get a card, find my books and check them out, all with enthusiasm. Yay for public libraries!"
"My husband and I recently got married at City Hall. It was amazing!! The lighting and architecture there are incredible! You can't ask for a more beautiful location and for the price, you'll never find one. Highly recommend this spot."
"I grew up going to see Mets games at Shea, which tended to be more like a circus/picnic than a baseball game experience.  I still love Shea, but Fenway is what a ballpark should be  - all about the game.  It's the Vatican of baseball and should probably be autonomous.  ,I hate hate hate idiot fans of any sport, and must say I've experienced more at Yankee Stadium than at Fenway.  Perhaps this is influenced by the differing stress levels of their home cities, but regardless of the cause,  the Fenway experience beats any other I've had hands down."
"Night game at Fenway. ,All day Red Sox nation was trying to compete with the ceremony surrounding the prelude and eventual actuality of Jeter's 3000th hit. Pasty Bostonians everywhere, decked out in throngs of red behaved themselves admirably, as they were all simply lost in the pageantry of a Saturday night at Fenway. Can't blame them; the Park is beautiful.,First off, as a college kid, Yakwey Way is a dream. It really shows that all those years of higher learning, job hunting, and being on the 9-5 grind can never TRULY beat the tailgating out of a man. Eating hotdogs and munching on funnel cake, while watching probably the most mediocre garage dad band croak mind-numbing sets into a crowd of bewildered fans, appeared like a usual Saturday Morning at the U. Beer everywhere. Red everywhere and unusually gorgeous selection of moderately ballpark priced kettlecorn and italian sausage for the entire fam bam.,A friend of mine, who earlier had been self-appointed as Boston's freedom trail tourguide, couldn't help herself as she pointed out location after location, within the stadium, where a murder took place in Ben Affleck's movie, the Town. Suddenly, the green tunnels looked more ominous as the policemen who patrolled those corridors all morphed to look exactly like Ben Affleck's character before he shot up half the security guards at Fenway. Fear spiked, when I realized that all of them had guns, which subisded a little later when I remembered that cops all have guns. ,Now, Cautiously approaching field level with kettle corn bag in hand, I was struck by how beautiful field level really was. The stadium is homely, yea, but the players seem so close, like they're just super, bearded versions of the varsity team in high school. Fans were goin HAM at every Ortiz swing, every Pedroia dive.  The food was great and affordable. The sun was out and the Sox won.,I understand why you love it so much, Affleck"
"Living in New York and being a Mets fan, I was accustomed to going to one of the most outdated ballparks in history. Shea Stadium was awesome because it never went corporate and was named after a guy who wasn't even an owner, he was just a guy that helped get the Mets established int Queens. Now Citifield even though it's corporate is an amazing Ballpark and I've heard the new Yankee Stadium is a palace.,Yet, nothing compares to Fenway Park (haven't been to Wrigley Yet). Baseball is an old time sport that's meant to be played in an intimate setting, not some cavernous dome or part-time football field.,The green, the brick walls, the memories, the fact that you are walking through history is something that can't be replicated. Even the concession stands, which offer lobster rolls and chowder, offer something neighborly to New England that makes the statement yes we use ads, but we're not completely corporate.,Overall, Fenway Park is hands down the most amazing ballpark I've been to. It brings you back to a simple time before ads and bloated payroll determined which team would be great year in and out. While ballparks have gone through phases of ultra large, ultra modern, and now ultra-retro, sometimes the best things in life never change."
"SO PRETTY!  And so obvious....,so I will tell a story.,In 1995, I worked for KITS Live 105.3, the Alex Bennett Morning Show.  Without launching into a tirade about that experience, I will tell you of the well thought out activities by the top notch management at that time.  I only remember a few things.... Everyone was on Zoloft.  Alex was a complete insecure narcissist.  Lori was sweet enough.  Curtis was a great guy if not loaded with problems.  Patty and Spud seemed like duplicitious jerks, grinning through their clenched teeth.  I need to realize that was a long time ago, and I might be remembering improperly.  ,Anyhoo.. they got Chuck to do a remote on 4th of July.  In front of City Hall, we passed out Oysters and Tiramisu to all the homeless people in front of city hall.,Did you read that... homeless.  Tiramisu and oysters.,I cannot believe they thought of that, and half believed they knew that these poor people had destroyed immune systems that couldn't handle foods like that.... ,We had a couple 100 bums clutching their tummies and curling up in the fetal position moaning.... puking everywhere.  It was horrendous.  I can't believe people didn't die... seriously.  I was so angry at the station for being that dumb, but I was angry at that station for being that station.  Ugh.,But at least the bum puke was tempered by the glory of city hall.,jeez... this town's got memories for me.  Wow."
"***Independence Hall is a must visit because of its history, but the tour was surprisingly bland and the experience was definitely weakened by the negative and uninteresting tour guide***,Independence Hall (the old Pennsylvania State House) is the home of many great historical moments in United States history and viewing the interior of this building feels really special.  There is a quiet and well-maintained (but not commercial or overly updated) feel that makes it easy to imagine the major events that happened here so long ago.,The area outside of Independence Hall is nice too.  It is a great looking building and the greenery, pathways and statues around the hall are all great.,The tour though was surprisingly bland and a lot of this was due to the very below average tour guide.  He had a very negative energy and attitude towards the history of the place.  He ended up making the historical proceedings here feel small and even somewhat insignificant.  He also delved way too deep into the details (focusing on minor characters and moments), which really detracted from the main storyline of this historical attraction.  It is definitely worthwhile learning something new, but I felt what was presented was very uninteresting.,Despite the poor presentation from the tour guide, Independence Hall feels special and worth a visit.  It is free to visit and not a long tour (it is a very small building), but you need to make sure you grab a ticket first at the nearby visitor center (a block or so away from Independence Hall).  With or without a great tour guide though, Independence Hall is still a major landmark and a must visit for those visiting Philadelphia.,There are a few pay parking structures near Independence Hall.  Metered street parking is also available."
"Fenway Park:,The seating could be more comfortable, the food could be better,  the parking could be more convenient and everything could be less expensive.  I do love visiting this great institution just as it is.  Happy 100th Anniversary!!"
Absolutely love this place.  You can just feel the history every time you enter the park.  And there is pretty much not a bad seat in the house.
"LOVE Fenway Park! My nephew went for the first time ever, and he said it was the best time he has ever had! The Joy on his face and in his heart and soul was the best! Energy at Fenway is amazing. Actually the energy from my nephew is AMAZING. We had Bleacher seats directly behind Sox bullpen. Have also been right behind home plate years ago with my son when he was a kid (those seats aren't too bad either)."
"Yeah yeah yeah ... lots of years of history ... but mostly a curse ... sure it was the team with the curse but it has to rub off onto their home field, right?    and it's the F'ing sox - muck the fox!!!,Only giving a 2nd star cause I'm not so much a hater that I can't respect years of tradition, even though it's been mostly losing  ( which is a GOOD thing )."
"Emerald grass grows / ,Big Papi lays down the bunt / ,Bleacher bums groovin'."
"What can I say that has not already been said about America's most beloved ballpark! This is a monument and in 2 years it should become a national historical monument! I have been coming to this great park since my first major league baseball game in 1995 and it will always hold a special place in my heart. I recently had the privilege of getting a group tour of this amazing park and it was just that, amazing. I got to see the inside of the press box, the Red Sox hall of fame, the actual foul pole that Carlton Fisk hit in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, and authentic jerseys that date back to the very origins of this storied franchise. I love this place with all of my heart and I highly recommend that any fan of the Red Sox or baseball in general go here and enjoy yourself a little slice of history!"
"This is quite possibly the best baseball atmosphere in the States. These fans are insanely passionate and as a Dodgers fan I have to say I was a little envious. Also being one of the three original stadiums, there is ton of history here. It was definitely standing room only when I came so I was thrilled to have scored a couple tickets last minute. There are seats with terrible sight lines so definitely find out which those seats are and avoid them.,Sweet Caroline is the perfect start to any 9th inning. And Pap closed it out. What a great game!,The beer flows to the end and they also have the fattest sausages outside on the concourse. Absolutely delicious!,They also have a team store right outside and the mark up isn't too bad.,This experience alone almost made me move to Boston. Extra star for getting me plastered under $50,GO DODGERS!"
Seriously what is there to say that hasnt been said... GO BOSTON!
"Of course we had to go here while we were in Boston. I mean, it was a dream of mine and my boyfriend's.....It's a freaking institution....and I'm closetedly obsessed with Big Papi even though I'm a die hard Padres fan. Well, I guess i'm out of the closet now and since last friday as I lost my shit everytime he stepped up to the plate. Fenway Park is a magical place. It's not super huge as far as parks go but it has history just oozing out of its pores...err bricks I guess. As we got off the sardine can of the subway packed to the brim with Sox fans and tourists alike all waiting to get off and see the wonderous sight that was to come, well and to breathe; it was physically wet on the T. ,Once we got there, it much more than lived up to its reputation in my mind. It's like a massive community block party outside this place every game.....people selling memorabilia, people spilling out of bars, sox fans and their families with their picnics, red white and blue soaking every square inch of the building not covered by brick or green. It's truly magical. ,Inside....its even better. We sat in the bleachers....which aren't really bleachers at all.....AND they were 12 rows behind the sox bull pen. We had a perfect view of home plate, the green monstah, and the john hancock sign.....all equally amazing, inciting all sorts of love, warmth and nostalgia. Or maybe that was the beer! The food selection is great....everything you've ever wanted to eat at a baseball game and then some. Chowder, fries, delux nachos, nuts, jacks, and of course fenway franks. These things are delicately wrapped in a bun that looks and tastes like white bread. So soft and tasty......and there is every kind of major brand of beer somewhere around your seats. They're expensive...but at what park is it not?Just shut up and pay 7.50 for a plastic pint of drinkability. ,Some other things that almost, and/or did make me cry:,1. Seeing Jonathan Papelbon warm up with Jason Varitek(King of the gay bear hotties), even though he wasn't catching the game. ,2. Singing sweet caroline in the eighth....drunk. ,3. Laughing at some actor from Burn Notice's highlariously bad first pitch. ,4. Watching Papelbon come out in the ninth to the dropkick murphy's.....this has been a wish of mine for many moons. ,And lastly, I will leave you with #5: Being able to have visited and gotten drunk and stuffed at one of the most wonderful magical and historic places on earth with the love of my life [barf, sorry, but it's real].,Signed with love and admiration,,Honorary member of the Red Sox Nation"
"If you're a Sox fan or a baseball fan in general, you go, you experience. Besides just taking in a game here, I enjoy meeting others who are at Fenway for their first time and also taking in the experience. If the cost of food and drink is too much for your budget, there's plenty of places nearby where you can eat and drink before or after the game."
"Beautiful beautiful city hall!! The weddings gives joy and celebration, Sometime they have events there. Once i was lucky to see Peruvian dancing with costumes and singing at christmas time :),Just a quit hall to find yourself in the middle of the busy city."
"The city hall at SF is out of all proportion for a city of this size. It is a beautiful building with massive public spaces in a grand European design. The details in the dome and wall carvings are amazing. The tour on the other hand is a bit slow moving. The guide was personable and knowledgeable. Unfortunately the tour mainly consisted of walking into a room with some displays and then standing in a corner listening to some anecdotes then whizzing past the displays. The stories were interesting, but it would have been better to tie them into the displays or other visuals.  The council chamber was also impressive but the main dome was the highlight."
"Wow, the biggest library I've ever stepped into!  The library is so huge.  There are so many floors here, they even have negative floors!!!  Each floor is devoted to a certain subject.  The library itself is beautiful inside and outside.  Honestly, you can probably tour this place for about 30-1hr, its that big and its a library."
"I can't make this 5 because I am a definite Yankees fan through and through.  The stadium is actually really authentic with wooden bleachers and country music?  Oddly, there was a lot of country music, but there wasn't a whole lot of prompting to get the crowd involved.  It was genuine when the wave went through 5 times in the 6th, and they had two women pantomiming ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"".  Ortiz did what he does best and Varitek hit one over the monster.  I really liked how you could see the bullpen easily and were so close you could hear the banter of the pitchers.  From a die hard Red Sox fan, she told me that given it was a day game, it wasn't nearly as rowdy as it could be but the weather was perfect."
"If you're a TRUE baseball fan like i am, you would truly appreciate fenway park. I would say it's the epitome of what a baseball stadium should be (and i've been to quite a few). Although i'm a DIE-HARD OAKLAND A's fan, I can truly appreciate a good ballpark when i see one. I visited this stadium last spring when I went to go see the A's play in Boston. Despite it being one of the oldest ballparks, it's very well maintained & vibrant. So much history and legacy behind it....and it's always packed with hard-core red sox fans that truly enjoy the game of baseball.  ,We got to experience ""Yawkey way"" where fans of all ages get to enjoy yummy all-american ballpark food & beers. There's acrobatics, and bands playing outside. And you get the smell of fresh hotdogs grilling on the stands.  When we were there, I actually got to see the great Dennis Eckersley doing the pre-game show outside.  And very surprisingly, did not get harassed from all the sox fans while i was sporting my green & gold. (But it's a total different story once you get into your seat & start rooting for the other team, especially when the home team is losing). The bf however is a whimp, and went w/ neutral colors, and tried to get me to tone down on my cheering most of the night.  We came early enough to watch batting practice and to get the full fenway experience.  There's a section of stadium in which they still have the original seats. Experiencing the green monster up close & personal was also great (we tried to get tix, but unfortunately were sold out, as is the majority of the seats). The food area was a site to see. It had almost a circus feel, and it brought back memories of the fun times i had as a kid going to the carnival w/ the fam & getting to enjoy delicious carnival food. We wanted to taste food we couldn't get anywhere else, & tried the fried dough topped w/ cinnamon which was very yummy, which also appeared to be very popular among the crowd. During the 7th inning stretch, we also got to experience the infamous red-sox nation's rendition of ""sweet caroline,"" which was a great site to see. The whole stadium is literally up on their feet & belching out the words to the song.,For being such an OLD stadium, it's definitely been well-maintained. There's not very many places i would go in which i paid the amount of money i paid, but the experience was worth every penny.,r/t airplane tix - $320,single game tix - $160,stadium food & drinks -$50,A's vs. Sox @ Fenway = PRICELESS"
"I was here on my East Coast trip for a tour.  The ballpark is small but there is a lot of great history here (See Wikipedia for the rest of that).  ,The tour is nice and extensive, and the guide friendly.  We were even lucky enough to walk on the warning track too!"
"4.5 stars.,As a wedding venue in San Francisco, maybe even most of the United States, nothing beats City Hall. We checked out a bunch of different elegant places in SF, Julia Morgan Ballroom, The Green Room, The Bentley Reserve and a few other places but as soon as my wife, then fiancee at the time, saw City Hall, we knew it was the place.,A lot of our guests were posting pictures on Facebook during the ceremony while we were standing on the steps and people were stunned by the venue and curious where the wedding was held. If you've never been you need to check it out. The architecture, columns, marble floors and details are out of this world and amazing.,The only reason I gave it a half star deduction is because it is a pricey place to rent, close to $15K in our situation and there is a lot of required paperwork, but it was well worth it. ,All of our guest said it was the most beautiful, elegant wedding they have ever attended. Check out our wedding video and you will see how beautiful this venue can be.,What's nice about City Hall is it can somehow hold 300 - 500 people and yet still feel intimate. If you can afford it, nothing tops City Hall for your wedding venue. Evey penny was worth it. And Elsie and the rest of the events staff are very helpful.,Choosing City Hall was one of the best decisions we made regarding our dream SF wedding."
Great Service easy people to deal with.... Thank you kindly.......
"The Facebook holiday party was held her this year...and it was magical! The event was turned into a red, gold, and silver dream. I love that the city allowed us to shut down a street so we could have a huge tent AND host the party indoors. Amazing by night!"
"beautiful oasis in downtown. i'm always surprised how nice the check out clerks are here. i take the metro here, it's so convenient."
We've got a pretty cool City Hall.  Gorgeous building. At least Willie Brown spent some of the surplus cash of the late 90s on refurbishing this old building.  Just wish they wouldn't lock the Van Ness doors so early....
"This is a BEAUTY!,I can't believe there was once motion to tear it down.,I feel like I'm in another world when I'm inside it.  This place blends the old with the new so perfectly when they rebuilt the part of the library that was damaged by the fire.,Being in here is inspiring.  It highlights how important libraries are to our community.  There are so many programs for kids to come to and the place is positive reinforcement for kids to stay in school and on the right path.,A little out of the way for me to make this my primary library to go to, but definitely a place to chill at when I'm in the area and don't want to eat and shop."
"Funky..I used to work here as a youth. Child Labor..lol When you walk into this place, its like WOW!!! Look at all the beautiful architecture that are like decades old. When I was here, it was all about Willie! Now its Gavin...I'm starting to hate the people but not the place.,You file for your married status here as well as get hitched. =]"
"The L.A. Central Library is the equal of any other central public library in the U.S. From its beautiful (IMO) architecture to its impressive collection, there's something for everyone here.  Also, a very cute little gift shop to browse as well.,I deducted one star because of: ,The large number of broken self-checkout machines I encountered.,The broken escalator on the second floor.  If you try to take the stairs, you'll trip the emergency alarm.  You have to take the super slow elevator instead.,For those who complain about parking: there is a metro station about three blocks away and plenty of bus stops all around.  Ditch the car or drive in on the less hectic weekends, since it is open on Sundays again."
Gorgeous architectural building inside. My mommy & daddy got married here. Came here after my college graduation to take pictures cause it's nearby.
"The highlight of my trip to Boston in 2002 was watching a baseball game at Fenway Park.  Everything was so simple.  On game day, it seems like everyone in Boston walks in one direction...toward the ballpark.  It's the polar opposite of my hometown park, AT&T Park in SF, which I also love.  There was no rap music playing after a player's name was called, no playgrounds or a Build-a-Bear shop for the kids, no fireworks after the home runs.  ,The fans come to watch baseball...period.  I can't even remember who they were playing or who was pitching that day, but Rickey Henderson did hit a lead-off homer in one of his last seasons as a pro...still loved him even though he wasn't in an A's uniform.  Locals should definitely treat their out-of-town guests to a Red Sox game, but probably drop the non-baseball fans off at another one of Boston's attractions."
"Five stars for the history (5) and another for the play on the field (6). Loss of a star due to self-importance of the fans (5) and another star for doing the wave (4). Add a star for Sweet Caroline (5), but lose a star for the ridiculous prices (4). Then lose two more stars because every seat down the right field line points in the wrong direction."
"Beautiful, historic, not as cool as Wrigley.  :D"
Beautiful.
"America was built here. I strongly advise you to take the tour. It's only 30 minutes, and it's not too hard on your feet. The building itself has remained in place since the 1740's, and saw the likes of Thomas Jefferson in his draft room writing out the Declaration of Independence -- which had forty-seven corrections, not because Jefferson was a bad writer but because too many blowhards wanted their take on precise language to how to make America its own country while shoehorning certain United Kingdom credences into the creation of the U.S.A. The tour spends time in three rooms, one of them the draft room as said, a second one the first supreme court. Fascinating. #historymaking"
"4 of us went there on the last Wed of May which turned out to be the coldest Wed in May EVERR since record-keeping began! Loved the old fonts on the kiosks, fantastic pitch, our seats were great ( got to see the game clearly unlike at the Dodgers stadium which was my 1st ever baseball game in USA and I wasn't impressed at all!) and truly felt like I was watching a scene from the myriad baseball-themed American movies in the 80s-90s! And we clearly brought some LA luck since RedSox won that night ( they had been on a losing streak apparently) and the WorldSeries2004 winners even showed up since it was their 10thyear anniversary! A must visit to this oldest ballpark in USofA! Extra star is for the fact that it was just a 20mins' walk there from our apt."
"Even though they've re-designed it numerous times now, it's still an awkward ball field.,It does have character, but that's about it.,It's smack-dab in the middle of an overcrowded neighborhood - good luck getting in and out of here for a game.  Insane.  Even the public transportation is just insanely packed before and after.  ,The field is nice enough.  It's just odd. And yes, we love our Green Monster - but - it's still awkward.  Like most places in Boston, it's cool yet cramped.,Still some seats blocked by colums.  WTF?,Overpriced beer.  They've changed the Fenway Franks on us.  This place skeeves me out."
"It has been said that Fenway is to baseball fans what the Vatican is to Catholics. When the Washington Nationals made the rare trip to Fenway I took vaca from work and made the trip to Boston. As an outsider used to newer fields these are my takeaways..,Pros:,Smaller stadium=better seats ,Awesome downtown location with tons of bars to pregame at,Close to metro ,Historic park that even non baseball fans want to go to,Cons:,These small, ""famous"" stadiums can charge whatever they want and people will still attend,$9 for a 12oz can of crap beer,As an old stadium it understandably lacks the modern amenities of new stadiums,I loved the stadium but spent a pretty penny to go. If you place the history of the stadium as the most important thing in a review this would be a 5 star review. If you look at it's intrinsic qualities its a 2 or a 3. Take it all with a grain of salt."
"It Fenway, enough said."
"The best place to see a baseball game, period., I've been to Fenway countless times (my family shared season's tickets with another family back in the 80s & 90s). There is nothing like the feeling you get when you hear the bat hit the ball and it makes that 'crack' noise, I'd like to say 'there are no bad seats in Fenway' but that's just not true. Some seats are 'obstructed view' where you may have a pole in front of you. But, if you lean a little to one side, you're all good. But, the thing about Fenway is, all the seats are SO close to the field, you can almost touch it. Not like the fields out west which are huge and the seats are set so far off the field you'd be better sitting in your living room., Things that are a must when going to Fenway:, 1. Take the T - green line to Fenway, 2. Fill the boot! - when you're walking to Fenway on a game day, you'll pass Firemen collecting money for the Jimmy Fund. You put your donation in one of the firemen's boots., 3. Sausage & peppas (that's peppers with the Boston accent) from a cart outside the stadium, 4. Buy your program outside - its cheaper and has all the stuff for the game you're going to see, 5. Buy your peanuts outside - they are fresh roasted and cheaper, 6. Get a Fenway Frank inside the park - best hotdog you'll ever eat - with ketchup and mustard - that's the way we do it here!, 7. If you're still hungry - go for the Legal Seafood's clam chowdah (that's chowder with a Boston accent), 8. Have fun!!"
"This is the 7th ballpark across the country that I have been to and wow - it's incredible.  To be at the oldest ballpark in the country is quite a feat.  It's gorgeous and classic; plus, it doesn't appear to have a bad seat in the house.  As a die-hard Dodger fan, it's not Dodger stadium (to me) but it's so fucking cool just to be here.  I got very giddy walking in this place and chills ran up my spine - it was definitely an honor to see a game here.  ,Even if you're not a Red Sox fan, you MUST come here just to experience the amazing-ness of this park and baseball in general."
"This is the best ballpark in America... Here are some helpful tips if you are visiting Fenway Park for the first time..,The quickest and most efficient gate to get into Fenway is at Gate E (across from Cask 'n' Flagon).  ,If you need to stretch your legs during the game, you can exit the park onto the street at Yawkey Way.  There's decent food and drinks there, even a large souvenir store (with tv so you don't miss a pitch) and you are still technically inside Fenway Park.,Make sure you do not buy ""OBSTRUCTED VIEW"" seats.  You'll be sitting behind a pole... Seriously!,I would avoid anything down the first base line much past first base until well past the right field foul pole (Pesky's Pole).  You'll be facing out toward the outfield and will have to crane your neck to the left to be able to see the infield (like everybody else in this section).  I wish they would angle the seats of this area toward the infield, but they haven't done this (yet).  Also, these seats will put you right into the glare of the setting sun if it's an afternoon or night game.  Once the sun sets, then it's no big deal (except for your sore neck the next day),The best seats are behind home plate and extending all the way down the 3rd base line.  These are some of the best seats in all of baseball.,If you are a large person or want/need extra room the best place for you is the State Street Pavillion or the EMC seats (very expensive though!).  All of the Grandstand seats, while being very good are quite cramped.  Just remember that with the new open areas at Fenway, you can always get up and stretch your legs.,Make a note of the Fenway Park Security Hotline.  There is an announcement before the beginning of every game with the Fenway Code of Conduct and the number of this hotline.  If anybody is being drunk or rude, obnoxious.. (which should not be tolerated), simply call or text the hotline and a Fenway staff person will help you out immediately.  They are VERY good at their jobs and want to make sure that people have a great time without being hassled.,I hope this information is helpful to you and that you have a fantastic time at Fenway Park!"
"Loved Fenway Park. I don't know really know how to review places besides restaurants, but hell, I'll review Fenway. It was a good time, went there to see the hometown Baltimore Orioles play the Sox. Nothing too special, if you're coming from out of town and don't have a car, getting off at the Kenmore stop on the T makes the walk to Fenway a good 5-7 minutes. There are hot dog stands next to Gate C and E and there is also a Qdoba near the Kenmore stop that open past 10 or 11pm, so you can easily grab a bite to eat. Other than that, beer is $9.50, Fenway Franks are $5.00, and nothing else really matters at a baseball game, am I right?"
"I can't believe that I never reviewed this place! Ah! Yelpers, I must tell you the story of the worst wedding ever (it was mine.) ,January 14, 2010. It is a Thursday morning. I have been up all night sewing an alternative back into my wedding dress. After two hours of sleep, it's time to get up and head to the courthouse to get married. This is already a disaster waiting to happen. ,I get dressed and grab my makeup to do in the car. Driving from the East Bay to SF on a weekday morning is asking for trouble. We need to leave now.,I know this is a mistake. I've been engaged for two years. We own a big house. We have pets. How am I going to get out of this? I'm not. There's a cancelation fee of less than $100 so clearly there is no turning back now. I'm 22 years old and I am dumb enough to think any of the aforementioned reasons, and especially the cancelation fee, are a true barrier to not ruining my life. ,I look down at my hand. I love my engagement ring. I don't want to wear any other piece of jewelry with it ever. I'm glad I decided against a wedding band. I feel like this is partially a good reason to go ahead and keep on toward City Hall. What was I thinking? ,Only 6 people are allowed to attend the ceremony because it's a courthouse. My family doesn't approve and they're not there. Oh well, we're both the oldest of four so I guess it works out - we'll just have my fiance's two friends be our witnesses that we are required to bring.,Well if this day couldn't get any more stressful, my fiance decides he's brining my least favorite person in the universe to City Hall - his overbearing Russian matriarch grandma. Kill me. We have to pick her up before we get to City Hall.,She criticizes my shoes. She also tells us that we're going to get divorced (she was right) & tells me I'm going to wear a family ring as my wedding band. I don't feel comfortable wearing a small car-priced ring. Plus it's hideous. Ugh.,We get to City Hall. Everyone oohs and awws over us as we walk inside. Grab a number and wait to be called.,As I lean against the pillars, I can't help but notice how stunning this place is. At least I'm getting married in the most gorgeous non-religious place I've ever been. ,After walking the halls with one of our witnesses for over an hour, our number is called. Thank God because I can't listen to his grandma nag me for another second.,Surprisingly the rooms off the main hall are like every DMV in America. We go from station to station stamping and signing documents. I'm so screwed. The papers are signed, technically I'm married. They give us a packet about sexual health. This is weird. ,There are other people getting married so we have to wait our turn to get married in the rotunda. Everyone looks so pretty. I feel sad. ,Our number is up. The officiant starts to speak. I zone out. What am I doing?,""Do you Stephanie..."" ""What? My name's not Stephanie"" I blurt out. The officiant reads my last name wrong and presumably thought it was my first name. This is so embarrassing. If they say the wrong name does that void the legality of the wedding?,It's time for the vows. ""Thank you so much, I'm his grandmother. I am from Russia and I live..."" Is this b---- really interrupting my wedding to tell the officiant about herself? ""Excuse me, can we finish this? It's not over"" I can't hide the vitriol in my voice between my clenched teeth. And why is she standing right next to him? I hate everything about this moment.,I don't understand why only 6 people can attend when there is an Asian bus tour surrounding us and taking pictures of us throughout the 10 minute ceremony. ,I high five my new husband when it's over. I hate my life. Apparently this was the cue for the tour to stand in line to take pictures with us holding up the peace sign. At least they have pictures because I don't. Not that I'd want them.,I am absolutely seething at his grandma. Of all times to stunt... On my ill-advised wedding day?! The officiant tells us we can get a copy of our license later but she has another ceremony to do.,God this place is pretty. It's actually breathtaking. I wish for a thousand things to be different but at least I picked such a gorgeous location. It's a beautiful disaster.,It's after 3. Traffic is going to be a nightmare. We have to be at our reception dinner with his whole family at 6 in Pleasanton.,My new husband (who is 27) decides it's a better idea to drive to South SF to wait out the traffic playing Call of Duty with his friends that accompanied us. It's totally necessary too because they're spending the night at our house after our dinner so that they can keep playing the game. We were so late. FML.,5 months to the day I decide I can't take a second longer of this and leave.,The only good thing about the marriage was the  gorgeous City Hall."
I LOVE this place.  My husband and i come here all the time to bring the kids or to do study sessions. We usually stick to the upper levels.  The Lower levels are awsome for research they have Everything you'll need. .. buut they aren't so great to sit in because they have homeless loitering down there which i have no problem with but i just don't want to kick it down there.. it can smell.. Anyways... great library haha
"I'm gonna ripped for this one, but it was really a crap experience.  I went to a game last year, was supposed to be a double-header with the Rangers.  It was a 3pm game I believe and it was raining, not hard, but drizzling.  I'm having a good time with some friends, drinking, meeting other people, etc...   Now it's about 6pm and I've already spent nearly $70 on beer and crap food, and it's still delayed.  My friends and I felt like grabbing something else to eat outside the stadium, when we get to the exit they told us that we couldn't come back.  Now that's just ridiculous.  The rain was stopping and starting at this point and they said it might start within the next 45 minutes.  We stuck around another 30 minutes, but nothing changed and they still told us another 45 minutes.  We left.,The thing that pissed me off the most was that later I found out from a friend that works for the Sox that they do this because their increase in concessions goes up 400-500%.   In the end they canceled the night game and played the day game late, and if anybody saw it on t.v. there was probably only a dozen or so fans still there, the stadium was EMPTY."
standing room only is the way to go. Every staff person I met in that place is nice too. Great place for a ballgame.
"Fenway park is the best ballpark!!! Better than Wrigley--this place is much smaller and filled with die-hard fans--and a great beer selection too--much better than the crap you get at most ball fields. They even have the old fashioned score boards---Fenway is the best ball park--even if you're not a baseball fan, you will appreciate this place!!"
"No one's gonna read this review. So, I'll write about it in cat. ,Meow.. meow-meow-meow. ,Meeoow? Meow. ,Meow-meow, meow meow meow. purrrrrrrrrrrr.... ,Meow meow meow meow meow; meooooow!,Meoooow meow San Francisco, meow meooow."
"An intimate day ceremony on the steps of the Rotunda is as stunning as an extravagant evening wedding in the Rotunda. And you'll be able to put that $100K towards your new home together.,""Some love stories aren't epic novels, some are short stories. But, that doesn't make them any less filled with love."" - Carrie Bradshaw"
"Beautiful inside and out. Not only is it architecturally beautiful, there are also a lot of captivating art pieces within the walls. There are so many floors to this place, it can be daunting at first visit. The librarians are very helpful though and can guide you to what you're looking for."
"This architectural treasure makes the State Capitol in Sacramento look like a hot dog cart, er, schintzel vagon (for now)."
"Beautiful building.  I love walking through here on my breaks from Jury Duty.  The architecture is impressive.  It's a great tourist stop for your visitors.  You may even see Gavin Newsom wander by, if you're lucky."
"My favorite library in LA.  There are many books, cd, magazines, and dvds here.  IT's one of the bigger LAPLs.,There are several floors you can spend all day in.  ,I used to always be here every weekend in high school. :)"
"We have one hell of a City Hall, I must say."
It's gorgeous..... came here on NYE for their donovan party via some gratuitous tix and had so much fun!! Different colored lighting inside at night makes it even prettier.
"BEST public library in Los Angeles! Literally they have (almost) every book you need. Some books are just for reference and need to stay in the library (out-of-print books mostly). Librarians are knowledgable and helpful. Once a Librarian tried to help me check out an out-of-print book on ""special terms"". ,I've seen bums here and there but overall well maintained and clean.,Endless cubbies on every floor, extensive foreign languages section, and DVD/CD/multimedia collection. What's not to love?"
Yet another reason why SF is my fav city. Period.
"Hands down the best baseball game I ever went to. Packed stadium v. Yankees. Fenway Franks, beers, sweet sweet onion breath, and a lot of rowdy Red Sox fans (they won from behind!). I hope I get to go back before I die."
"Best place to watch a baseball game!!,Home to Red Sox Nation..some of the GREATEST fans!!,I finally got to check watching my Sox play at Fenway off my bucket list. ,This place is LEGENDARY. More intimate than most MLB stadiums. And such a better vibe. ,You're surrounded by fans who have the same love for their team that you do. ,I didn't mind the tight quarters or crowds and lines. All part of the experience. ,EVERYONE should see a game at Fenway!!"
"I would give 4.5 if I could.,I'm thrilled Fenway still stands, I was pissed at Nomar and T. Williams when they supported a new park back in the day. I hear rumors a new park could still happen, it'd better not! I love that it's always packed, especially compared to watching other teams' stadiums with depressingly low attendance.,The park feels more and more sell-out-ish since '04; some of it's necessary evil, other is simply business savvy, but it's cleaned up a bit too much for my taste. Little too sterile and family friendly (fuck families! j/k),I would love if they made a peanut free section, my poor 8 yr old half sister can't grow to love baseball as I did my entire childhood living outside Boston. I know that's all new-age PC, but it's close to home.,Concessions are lovely enough, but I still suggest hitting a sausage stand outside ""the system"" on the way in or out."
"The building is very nice, and is worth going to see for that alone if you are from out of town. I've been to a number of parties there, and they do well with large events when companies rent the entire place for evenings.,Aside from that, the purpose of any City Hall is to provide service. And the service you get there is top notch.,I needed to get a Passport renewed for my son when I realized a week before a trip that his had expired the month before. SF City Hall can take care of you if you have three business days before your trip, and you can then pick the finished passport up at the San Francisco Passport Agency.  If you have at least four business days, I'd suggest going directly to City Hall, since the line there was not terribly long, and the service was good. You take a number and a seat, then get called up to a desk where you can sit while the person across from you takes care of everything, which beats waiting in line and doing it at a window at the Passport Agency. Also, parking in the lot across the street came out to $3. I was third in line when I got there, and there was nobody behind me when I was being served, so getting there close to noon might mean there won't be a line.,Once you finish up at City Hall, you will have a ""Will Call"" slip to take to the Passport Agency (US Gov't agency, not City Hall) between 3 and 4pm on the day it's ready, or between 10 am and 4 pm on later business days. If you have the time, the big advantage of not going at 3 pm is traffic. You could also have it all taken care of at the Passport Center if you have less than three days, but you might as well go to City Hall and make things easier.,While you are there, you might see people getting married, which is another popular event people have there."
"Our family is not a sightseeing family. We like to get things over with and done. Independence Hall required us to stop and savor the history of our country. We loved it. The Rangers were knowledgeable, giving us insight into the true stories, not what we might have learned in school. The Liberty Bell nearby was fascinating as well."
"It's the Green Monster!  I was really excited when we first arrived at Fenway because all of Yawkey Way right outside the stadium is entirely blocked off for fun times before the game.  That right there made me a huge fan of this stadium.  There was a lot going on outside (music, food, beer, etc.) and lots of photo opportunities.  ,Inside was a totally different story - as a baseball stadium novice (meaning I don't go around the country visiting baseball stadiums) I was really shocked by the way this park looked.  I have never been in an old stadium because I was too little to go to Old Comiskey and I don't go to Wrigley as a personal rule.  I really liked the traditional feel of the stadium - there were ramps and weird stairs everywhere and there were bizarre levels I've never seen in a park before.  ,Tons of food choice (including clam chowder) and lots of Budweiser to satisfy your needs.  Tons of souvenirs to be had and lots of people to bump in to.  We sat in the ""bleachers"" (which were not actually bleachers but individual seats) so we didn't really get to view the big wall of the outfield since we were right over it.  We had a good time, anyway, and there was plenty of food to be had in the stands so you didn't have to get up.  No beer, though, so beware!  There is no beer served up in the bleachers so you have to get up to get drunk.  ,I really enjoyed my first major league game in a new park - even though it was rained out, the stadium is a fun place to look around and a great place to see a game.  I feel bad for the guy with the obstructed view seats, but it looked like there was a great amount of excellent seating to be had.  Obviously a staple for those in Red Sox Country and a great place to visit for a game indeed.  As a side note, I did not get to meet Wally the Green Monster and I'm very disappointed.  He was wearing a rain coat on the day we went!"
"Obviously a review of Fenway isn't going to sway anyone at this point...you have had nearly a century to visit...,The best sports venue of any sort in my book.  The park improvements are very impressive since I first went in the early 1980s.  Parking is always terrible, public transport is terrible and there are many obstructed views and hooligans running around various games...but all that does is add to the fun.  I have been to many, many venues in all sports and nothing even comes close.  A rare place where you can say this is better than TV since you are typically so close to the field and players."
"this should be  the Mecca to baseball fans. Fenway and Wrigley are the two most historic ball parks and because the cubs are still world series-less in 104 years....FENWAY WINS,I have been with yankee fans and they still got the goosebumps when they entered. ,best tasting 8 dollar bud light i have ever had.,gotta get a frank too so bring your wallet but hey, splurge, your as close to heaven as you can get"
"My 100th review! ,Five stars are for the experience - there really is no other baseball experience like Fenway Park.  Sure, it's old, and there's a good chance you won't fit in your seat that was built in the early 1900s or have the view completely blocked by a pole.  Generic stadium it is not....this ballpark has tons of character, and is located right on the city streets.  I've been here for some games that live on in history and wouldn't trade that for more comfortable seats or a giant parking lot to tailgate in.  I've written my name on both foul poles, inside the Green Monster, and have watched games from almost every section of the park.  As it has been written about numerous times, the fans are rowdy, intense and also very knowledgable (mostly...that's changed slightly in recent years).  Love the atmosphere on game days and the excitement felt when entering the ballpark...it's indescribable.  Great to visit, even if you are not a fan of baseball.,Here's some tips- ,1. Food- As with all stadiums, the food is expensive so expect to pay a premium.  Places for the ""good"" food are the Legal Seafood chowder stand behind home plate (or in the suites), lobster rolls at the upper right field deck.  A little biased here, but Coke Corner...you can get beverages here that are not available anywhere else in the park.  I'm not really a Yawkey Way person but many people like the food out there and you can access those stands during the game too.  I've also seen the ""monster dog"" on the Green Monster- I don't like hot dogs but if you do, this should be something you should get.,2.  Bathrooms- walk a little further to the renovated areas...renovated areas mean renovated bathrooms.  Upper deck right field roof, upper deck left field, left field concourse, Green Monster, Coke Corner...  Also, ""family bathrooms"" are fairly new and good for if you have kids, or if you just like a lot of room when you are peeing.,3. I've sat in sections all over the park...one overwhelming factor is that the fans are great everywhere you go.  Must try at least once- the luxury sections:  Green Monster, Luxury Suite, Right Field roof, Pavillion.  If you sit up higher, it's cooler so bring a jacket if it's not mid-summer.  ,4.  Stay to the end.  I can't tell you how many games I've been to that were walk-offs or 9th inning nailbiters...you won't regret it when you can say ""I can't believe you left- it was unbelievable!"".  ,5.  Exit strategy- if you drove and parked nearby, forget about it.  Go get some food and come back to your car.  I recommend parking along the green line T, escaping out Lansdowne St or Yawkey Way, and cutting through the Red Sox parking lot to get back to your car.  Avoid Kenmore Square pre and post game.  I won't give away my pre-game spot but it's somewhere along the green line.,6.  If you have time, take a tour...you'll learn some really cool facts and visit some behind-the-scenes areas of Fenway."
"I'm a Yankee fan but went to school in Boston.  i can split the difference - I love Fenway Park and hate the Sawx.,Just off of Kenmore Square, this park is in a great location.  One of the few ballparks where it's not uncommon to hang out in the area even if there's no game going on (I don't go out to bars near Yankee Stadium even on gameday...).  I remember once being unable to get Yankee-Red Sox tickets and having a BLAST at Boston Beer Works with some friends.  (favorite moment:  some a-hole from NY who insisted on pounding Guinness.  who chugs Guinness?),The ballpark occupies a city block which was common in the early 20th century ballparks (the most famous other one being Ebbets Field - the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers).  The Green Monster was more or less borne out of necessity to squeeze the stadium within the allotted area.,Special treats about seeing a game in Boston:,1) Sitting in the right field bleachers and watching the fans just berate the opponent's bullpen. Not for the faint of heart or those turned off by vulgarity.,2) Listening to Red Sox fans.  Yeah, it gets boring after a while but you haven't lived until you've heard a fan yell out ""You Saaack"" (You Suck) at a Red Sox game.,3) The Fenway Tour - Went on this about 10 years ago and it was fantastic.  It was even better back then b/c they hadn't won the World Series yet and the tour kid must've said ""....and then the Kearse of the Bahmbeeno"" 20 times during the tour.  Priceless.,Recommend hitting the bars after the game (Cask & Flagon and  Boston Beer Works are just two examples) and grabbing a Sausage and Pepper sandwich outside the stadium.  Watch out for the drunk Southies who are itching for a fight - especially if you're wearing visiting team paraphernalia...."
"I can see why Fenway is one of the best ball parks and I have only been to two of them! The old-fashioned atmosphere and structures would surely be tough to beat. Being such a small ball park means that you never really feel far away from the game no matter where you sit. ,This is the second year that I've gone since going a lot when I was younger and both times that I went we had a lot of fun even the the results were disappointing (first games ended in 6-innings due to rain and next was a blowout). ,I would recommend getting there early to walk around and check out the shops and restaurants. And let me jut say that it is a lot easier being a Rays fan at Fenway than a Yankees fan!"
"LOVE FENWAY PARK! It is an amazing place. There is a warm, cozy, family-like atmosphere. But, it is time to upgrade the seats a bit! We had dugout seats for a playoff game and were cramped because there was a body-builder type guy sitting next to us. We love the park, but don't like being sardines. The other improvements, including the scoreboards, monster seats, etc. have only made this place better! Go Sox!!!"
During a brief visit to Boston we decided we wanted to see Fenway Park but since we didn't have enough time to buy tickets for the game we took a tour inside for 16 dollars.  The inside of the park is majestic and offers an experience of history and baseball like no other.  The tour allows you to view the park and take pictures from multiple seating areas and walking though those enclaves and stairs I could only imagine what it would be like to watch a game here.  It's amazing to have such a history monument for a national pass time offering stillness and tradition while surrounded by a world constantly in flux.  I hope to return one day and watch a baseball game here.
"Granted I only have a handful of Government agencies to compare to, but SF City Hall has to be one of the most gorgeous facilities around. Sure it's not the Spanish Guggenheim or the Taj Mahal, but It's beautiful, it's curvy, it's refined, and it's omnipresent from just about any elevated vista throughout town. SF City Hall is basically the Beyonce of Government domiciles whose HOA fees come from the tax paying public, while just about every other government branch resembles the entire cast of Mob Wives. Woof! ,While the image of getting married at any city's City Hall seems like an unromantic journey into holy matrimony, it's different at SF City Hall. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find a more whimsical, inspiring destination to complete your nuptials with the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. It's such an amazing gift to residents of San Francisco to have something like this. Being able to celebrate one of the most significant days of your life in an architectural marvel surrounded by love and equality is about as good as it gets.,I live in New York, but my heart will always be in San Francisco. The current political uneasiness surrounding tenant rights, chronic homelessness, and countless other issues notwithstanding... this very building is one of many reasons to feel proud about being a San Franciscan."
"Why, oh why is this my first time experiencing the grand Downtown Los Angeles Central Library?? Its stunning...it really is a sight to see.,My hunny knows that I love to read and that I love books (no kindle here...this girl needs something tangible...and I love the scent of old books) and brought me here as a date. Good job!,I absolutely love the achitechture, the old tiles in the gardens, the painted ceilings, the opulent rotunda. Stunning! ,We started by browsing the 3rd floor fiction books. Worked out way down to the children's section amd galleries. They have the incredible African American Military Portraits from the American Civil War in the Getty gallery. Then we checked out the first floor and gardens outside before we headed out to the rest of our date."
"Watching a Sox game can be fun, but dealing with a throng of obnoxious Red Sox fans at Fenway Park can sour the experience very fast- if you go to Fenway Park and are not a Red Sox fan, expect to be treated shabbily, and  be threatened with physical violence by the moronic baseball cap wearing Red Sox fans-,Avoid this den of eniquity like the plague.."
"Ok, I'm not much of a baseball fan. But the Fenway experience is a must, regardless. The park is small and lovely, and has so much history! Like all professional sports venues, you can expect to spend a good $50 on food and drink, even if you have restraint. But I mean, you HAVE to get a Fenway Frank or two, it's basically the law. Or should I say the lawrr. The seats are surprisingly comfortable, and since the park isn't so big, you can see the players fairly well. Unless you're behind a pole. You have to check it out, but not when they're playing the Yankees. Cuz that mess is expensive and terrifying."
Anybody who gives Fenway Pahk a less then 5 stah rating is an asshole!!
"It really is beautiful inside.  I had no idea how many weddings they do here a day.  It was interesting to see all the different outfits people wore for their ceremonies, and no one seemed put off that it was essentially a mill of wedding ceremonies.  I just saw a lot of smiles and tears of joy, hopefully.,The county clerk's office was easy to deal with and we were in and out in no time."
"NYE 2008 Party,City Hall is beautiful. I hooked up my friends with VIP table (front and center with the view of rotunda). We had a blast. Thanks John C. & Steve C. ^_^ ,The only thing I didn't like is the bathroom. I only saw one. City Hall should have at least a bathroom on the 2nd floor, were VIP section located.  We mostly hang out on the 2nd floor, we had a bottle service (a must) to avoid waiting in line at the bar & enjoyed some food (sushi, chicken on the sticks and spring rolls).,The main DJ can do better though, mixes were abrupt. What happened to my friend, DJ Kevin of Element. Oh well!,Great pics. taken by my friend Jon F. ^_^,Most impt. thing is spending time with love ones and friends...Happy 2008"
"BEAUTIFUL! Great architecture and selection- especially of e-books. But you can use more self-check out stations. There were some homeless people when I visited, but not many. (Though some sections really stank of urine.)"
"Used to work here as an intern when I was 16. By gosh, it was the best experience ever. To be sure, the building took my breathe away."
"I love coming to this library....it's close to work and it gets me out of my office! It's one of the nicest buildings in downtown...lots of character. Try not to come during peak lunch hours (12-1:30 pm) as everyone lines up to return and check out books then. They have 5 floors of amazing selections of books....I always get all my books from here. At times there are some homeless people inside but apart from that, it's one of the best libraries in town. ,I always check their catalog online and you can get any book transferred to this location. It's really good when you are planning vacations as you can get almost any travel books from here...they carry frommers, ricks steves, phrase books in various languages and lots of books in the history section (last level as you go down the escalators).,Also, as someone else mentioned, they have a great gift shop...really nice articles and souvenirs. Overall, It's an awesome library...Take the metro to downtown, walk a few blocks to Grand and 5th. The walk up the steps on bunker hills with all your books is the best exercise too!"
"My company had an event here and it was gorgeous. Perfect place for, especially, a large-scale event in the city. Our liaison, Elsie McAteer, was extremely helpful, friendly and especially skilled at handling celebrities/dignataries.  Hard to believe after staging an event there that this place is a working City Hall during the day!"
"This fantastic library is the jewel in the crown of the City of Angels.  It's spots like this that prove L.A. is a world class city.  Take an escalator ride down to the other levels and enjoy the skylights/glass ceiling.  Roam around upstairs to nooks and crannies that make you feel like you're in a posh private club or an upscale Starbucks.,This is one of those places like Disneyland that you fantasize about hiding out in, when they close, so you can have it all to yourself and spend the night.,Of note: the library shop is REALLY good.  Amazing card selection.  Many hip and/or cheeky knic knacs to buy as gifts."
"I will get married here.,Coming from the mid west when i tell people i want to get married in SF city hall they cringe.  I know what they are invisioning... a run down state office building with a musty smell.  ,Not in SF.  After seeing pictures they agree.  I will be getting married here."
"I'm totally spoiled by the fact that I grew up about an hour away from baseball's greatest monument.  A few weeks back, I took my nephews there for their first Red Sox game.  It's funny how little kids are so much different from us jaded adults.  I've been to Fenway more times than I can count, and I've never done this, but when I was telling my nephews about the red seat and Ted Williams' home run, they asked to see it.  We were very early for the game.  So I took them over.  It was pretty cool to actually check it out.  I'm not usually a bleacher guy, though.  I think that to get the full experience, you should sit in the old, uncomfortable, wooden chairs down either baseline.  I also attended an event on a non-game day at the EMC club.  It's a great place to have a conference if you're ever looking to do something like that."
"Awesome stadium...it is well maintained, clean, and beautiful. Even though it has been around for 100+ years, it is still one of the nicest stadiums we have visited."
"This may be biased since I work at Fenway but Fenway Park is the best!!!,Games- Watching a Sox game at Fenway is obviously a much different experience than sitting at home or at a bar. You have the vendors running up and down there stairs screaming ""Peanuts! Italian Ice!,"" fans that are locked to their seats watching attentively to every pitch and run, and of course the beauty of the historical park. Win or lose, watching a game at Fenway will always be exciting. If you come early when gates open, you might be able to catch a glimpse of Sox players,visiting players, or even celebrities running around the park (I've seen Ben Affleck, Dane Cook, Rihanna, etc...).,Crowd- Is always fun and varies from the Diehard fans to summer campers to families with a million kids! If you want some real fun, definitely go to a Yankees game. Even though, they are our rivals, Yankee fans + Boston fans = a whole lot of FUN.,Food-Chicken and fries with honey mustard is a godsend. So delish! Especially when its hot out of the fryer. I am not a fan of the Italian Sausage with Onion and Peppers but 90% of fans would say different. Fenway Franks are always good. Definitely get a soft serve in a Boston Red Sox Helmet if you are with kids ($5) and they are always served by the nicest girls in Fenway (me!).,Drinks- At $8-9 per draft beer, it may be expensive but compared to Yankee stadium, it's cheaper and delicious! New on Yawkey Way are Raspberry Lime Rickey's which are definitely worth a buy on a hot day or even just a soda or Lemonade is good too!,Parking- There is plenty of parking around fenway but be ready to shell out  $25 or so to park nearby. But honestly, the T is the best so you don't have to deal with all the traffic afterwards!,Tours-It's been a while since I went on a tour but the guides are the most knowledgeable people at Fenway! Definitely go on a tour if you have never been on one! You get to sit at all the different sections and learn about the retired numbers and etc...,Bars-So many around the park, so even if you aren't at a game, a trip to Game On!, Boston Beer Works, or Cask n' Flagons is always fun."
"Gas money to get to SF = $10 dollars.,Parking in front of City Hall for 1h30 = $4.75,Being the witness for one of my best friend's weddings at the SF City Hall during the holidays = Priceless,This place is amazing. You walk in and inside you get this warm fuzzy feeling like yes, there are beautiful man made places like this that exist in America. And during the holidays they have beautiful Christmas trees up inside the building with 1000 paper cranes as the ornaments. It's definitely a sight to behold at the top of this brilliant staircase. ,And where you go to get your marriage certificates they call out numbers on this huge speaker system along with an LED display. It's hilarious."
"It's worth the visit. It's small and touristy, but some cool stuff happening in here, and it's fun to imagine so many important moments happening in such a humble location. You'll need to get a timed ticket in advance. I've seen some reviews saying you can get them at the visitors' center, but when we showed up early in the morning, they were already sold out for the entire day. Good thing we got them from , well in advance. Seriously, people, it's worth the $1.50 service charge. We showed up 20 minutes or so early, and they wouldn''t let you in - so, keep that in mind. You'll also need to go through a security line, can't bring in any large bags, and you might have to do the spin and get patted down routine. Oh well.,After you leave the tour, make sure to hang a sharp right and enter the smaller building next to the hall. They keep all the doors closed and don't hang many signs, so you might not even realize there was stuff in there. But stuff there is."
"If you have never had the pleasure of visiting a modern, comfortable baseball stadium, you will think Fenway Park is great. Parking and concessions are astronomically expensive, the seats are tiny and have no leg room. Many seats have views obstructed by poles. The best things are the spirit of the Red Sox fans, the meticulous maintenance of the field, and the lack of foul territory which creates a relatively intimate viewing experience."
"AHHHH. I'm struggling to give FENWAY a 4 star rating, as a Red Sox fan and/or a baseball fan in general. So, I'm making it a 4.33 to ease the guilt. I 100% love the Red Sox and I love going to Fenway Park. I even love the anticipation of going to a game with the thousands of others who all stuff themselves into the green line. Ughhh there's some guys armpit uncomfortably close to my head, but hey he's a sox fan to so it's almost kind of ok with me! And once you get there, the atmosphere is the best. Then comes the game, you get to sing, yell, cheer, and youuuuuk to your hearts desire. I will admit I do hold myself back a bit, for fear that I will embarrass those I am with. But I still have a great time. ,However, I am poor. Food prices are expensive as expected, and tickets aren't the most affordable. And unless I'm mistaken they didn't have ""promotional days"" before this year. Still no freebies like other parks. Plus specific RF Box seats will give you neck problems (I learned my lesson). But if it weren't for the fact that I am a tad bitter from the lack of accommodations for my college life/general life brokeness, 5 stars it would be. Perhaps one day......"
"I though this place would be a rat hole and smell like 100 years of piss. Boy, was I wrong. ,My family surprised me with my first trip to Fenway. Now, in Philadelphia,born and raised, on the playground my momma said most of my days... sorry, wrong Philadelphian. But I don't like Boston, not one bit. Hate the Bruins, the Pats, the Sox, and especially the Celtics. But getting to Fenway and to Wrigley have been on my list, and we finally got a chance to go.,The surrounding neighborhood is awesome, with bars and restaurants to entertain anyone. But it's the Park itself.... clean, historic, friendly even. We sat in the centerfield bleachers in relatively new plastic seats, unlike the 90 year old wooden ones in other areas of the park. In those seats, you better not have a large arse, or you ain't sittin'.,Make sure you take the tour (see another one of my reviews for that) and have a Fenway Frank.,A great day!"
"With the exception of the two beer rule, this place is great! Food is good and the lines are reasonable."
"A classic beauty.  Bow you wish that they could find a way to keep this stadium forever.  In the middle of Boston, the surrounding area is great, really feels like the neighborhood team.  I was surprised at what a small park it was (compared to today's standards).  The Green Monster is much smaller in person, but still absolutely awesome."
"We ran out to see this when I was in Boston recently on a business trip since it seemed almost sacrilegious to visit Boston and not see Fenway Park. As soon as you get to the stadium, you can just feel the history oozing out of the pores of this place. Let me clear....I don't even like baseball and seeing Fenway Park made me want to buy a hot dog and a beer and go watch a game. They had a game later that night on the day that we visited, we got there earlier in the afternoon and they had just started cooking the food, you could smell it about a block away. ,They had a lot of cool souvenir shops on one side of the stadium and on the other side of the stadium there was a sports bar that had a banner hanging over it proclaiming ""voted best sports bar in America by ESPN"" or something like that. Anyways, I think it would have been really cool to go in there on a game day as well. If you are a really hard core Red Sox fan, they have some apartment buildings not far away as well as some nice shops and restaurants. The whole area around the stadium appears to have been revitalized, it looks good!"
Historic.
"This place is awesome.  It's so old school cool, classic Americana.  The fans are amazing, the place has stood the test of time, and it doesn't matter if you're not rooting for either team, it's a wonderful place to spend an afternoon.  Definitely the highlight of my trip to Boston."
I loved Fenway park when I visited years ago. I recently visited Wrigley and have to say that I enjoyed Fenway much more.  I was lucky enough to score some tickets behind the RedSox dugout and even got a ball thrown to me from Pedro Martinez. If I lived on the East Coast I would try to make it here more often.
"Came here for a tour and I was SHOCKED that parking was SOOO easy. ,Bunch of spots for 4 hours max @ $3/hear.  More than enough space.  ,Really didn't need to stress about BARTing in or parking all the way over at Chinatown ,Anyways, the City Hall tour was AWESOME but it would be perfect if they did it on the weekend too."
"Beautiful and spacious!,I haven't been to a library in years (you know, with the internet being around and all that...), but I never realized how beautiful the LA Central Library was!  ,I've been to the Central Library in NYC, so I know big libraries and I've done research there too.  This place looks a lot more modern, and there are catalog computers EVERYWHERE!  No need to wait in line or for your number to be called here.  ,The directory is easy to follow, and the staff is very helpful.,I will definitely be doing my music writing here quite often!"
"Being a Red Sox fan is a birth right. Perhaps the greatest in all of sport. There aren't fans as passionate, as straight Die-hard as Boston Red Sox Nation. This park has the all-time record for consecutive sell-outs and it's still going today. In my opinion, there is no better leisure activity in this town than seeing the Sox play at Fenway. ,Yes the food and drinks are grossly overpriced, yup many of the seats are small and cramped and you may just be the unlucky guy whose view is obscured by a giant steel girder, but ya know what, if you don't like it - GO SCREW! Fenway is the most classic, historically rich stadium in the country. It is a national landmark and a true experience to attend. ,I've sat all over the park, from the bleachers to the glassed-in 500 Club (not as fun, you can't hear the crowd) and everywhere is good. I haven't checked out the two newest additions yet: The Monster seats, which are exorbitantly expensive and the Rooftop area that just opened this season. The pricing on that isn't crazy so maybe I'll try it. ,If you live in Boston and have never experienced Fenway, do yourself a favor and make it happen. It's a right of passage for any true Sox fan and a privilege for everyone else. Long live the Sox, long die the pink hats, what fuckin curse? I'm out."
"Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park....awesome place to go. We went on a non game day and did the tour which was really interesting. Sitting where the TV & radio announcers broadcast from, over by the ""green wall"" and out in right field gives you a real feel for the place. You learn the history of the organization and having just read the biography of Ted Williams made it even more engaging."
"I realize that a billion people have reviewed Fenway park and all probably say similar things about the facilities so I decided to talk about one of my experiences at Fenway park from years ago to mix things up a bit.  ,Back in 1994, when the steroid plagued Roger Clemens was a member of the Red Sox, I attended a game against the Mariners.  It was one of the most memorable games of my life.  I was young then and knew nothing of steroids or of how Clemens would join the evil empire known as the Yankees.  Clemens was my idol growing up.  ,The game I went to was special because after a rare DH substitution twist, Roger Clemens, a pitcher in an American League game, had to get up to hit.  If you know anything about baseball then you know how rare that is.  The great part was that when he walked into the out preparing to hit, I was only 5 feet away from him.  I was sitting in the second row, right behind the on deck circle.  This was one of the most exciting moments of my life.  Turns out, Clemens got a single up the middle and Fenway went crazy.,This is how I look at Fenway, a place to go for great experiences.  It is a historic park and, even with rat problems, this place deserves 5 stars.  The facilities are crappy, food is expensive, seats are tight, but to see those beloved Sox play, it is all worth it.  For the few that have never been here, you must go to at least one game in your lifetime.  It is such a unique park and a must stop for any fan of the game."
"Strangely going to see City hall was one of the things that I wanted to do while I was in San Francisco. So I walked there and was surpirsed to find several food trucks outside. Even before I get inside this place is already awesome. I walk in and it just so happens that I am 10 minutes there before the next free tour, sign up? Heck yeah.,While waiting the 10 minutes I saw about 10 couples whom either just got married were getting married or were waiting. All of them beautiful. I didn't know any of the girls but all were so gorgeoous and happy that I wanted to go up to all of them and congratulate them. They were all taking wedding photos inside cause it is just that gorgeous. So gorgeous that I think I found the location for my wedding. I am not the kinda girl that gets super excited about weddings but this place sparks something inside of me.  ,The inside is just gorgeous!!!!! The tour was free and I learned actually a lot. It will probably be a little dry for those who are not into history or arcituecture. It was very intresting about how they have pretty much earthquake proofed the place. Also the dome is taller than the nations capital. OMG!!!,I love this place I took about a million photos every one of them is gorgeous."
"Pretty library, hard-working staff. At first glance the exterior looks almost as dingy as the rest of the block, but it's much brighter and nicer inside. Seriously, you kinda just want to hug the walls out of gratitude (yes, I'm a bookworm). I've also seen the walkway outside used semi-frequently as a backdrop for short film shoots. Anyhow, setting up an account here was quick and easy. I was really stingy when it came to textbooks so if I couldn't find it in the campus libraries or borrow a spare copy from my professors, I came here to fulfill my penny-pinching needs... and all the books would cost me was about 2-3 round trips' worth of bus fare a semester."
"After abandoning libraries for the past, oh, 25 ish years, glad I came. Its so big you need days to figure out everything, but they have some great finds in all subjects. Floors and floors, so THATS where my taxes go. Well spent for one instance at least. ,The second floor has children literature, and my son loves geronimo stiltion and captain underpants, etc, so its great to find them here and check them out free instead of paying $5-10 a book. Better late than never.,2nd floor has some computer usage but literally smells like ass+death+homeless combined. I feel sooo sorry for the librarians assigned to this section they should receive a medal of honor for not passing out, I am dead serious its terrible. ,Lots of people just sit and sleep on the couches, no control. I guess they cant profile anyone. Maybe when the fleas start buzzing then they will do something, what a scary section. I had to pick up my nose from the ground when I left that section. Thankfully, many other sections, even a panda express downstairs that doesnt charge airport prices. Quick, easy check ins and out, even a dvd section. ,You can even renew your books online, its awesome. -1 star for that funky-ass ass-smelling death room (floor 2),I havent even been to over 70% of it its just too big."
"I love this library! It's gorgeous, historic, equipped, utilitarian, etc. I can't believe I hadn't come here before. Multiple stories, beautiful architecture, a garden outside, I can go on and on. I could spend days here and not get bored. You can take tours. I came late with a friend, so we did a self guided tour; you pick up a packet from the information desk and follow the directions that will take you around the entire library. If this library was close to me, I'd be here every week."
"We couldn't have picked a more epic and gorgeous location to get married! We rented out part of the 4th floor for about $1000- it was intimate and on a Tuesday at 11am we basically had the place to ourselves except for that bus-load of asian tourists that swarmed us with their cameras like the paparazzi as we stood on the grand staircase to take some photos... but hey, it was fun! ;oD  Would recommend this place to EVERYONE!"
"Finally my first ever professional game in a stadium!!! Unbelievable but yes it is true.,This was not my first visit to the Fenway though. The first time I went here was when my company organized a summer outing at the Fenway. It was super fun that day to have the whole stadium for yourself. Guides were out there to give a tour of the Fenway and a chance to sit at some of the most wanted seats in the whole stadium. First thing that struck me was the playing field was not as big as seen on TV. That makes for some good viewing from most places. ,So finally when I decided to go for a game, inspite of getting seats in the belachers, I was able to feel a bit close to the game. But the closeness stops there. I never knew that there are some rituals that you do when you go to an actual ball game. So imagine the confused look on my face when all of a sudden, people get up and start singing to the PA. But in the end it was all fun, and I was able to get a laugh out of it."
Went to an open house to view the brick we purchased to commemorate the passing of my father in law. KUDOS ! the display was fantastic and the people were so helpful in locating our brick...THANK YOU FENWAY (& the Red Sox too) now go out and win some games !  !
"I must admit, I do not believe Fenway Park needs a review. It is a place to visit even if you do not particularly care about baseball. You can sit in a small seat and look out over a green field and think about the history. ,You're sitting in the same space that President Woodrow Wilson was in when he watched the 1912 Red Sox beat the New York Giants in game 2 of the World Series. The same place that Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, and Yaz played. Joe DiMaggio, Reggie Jackson, Nolan Ryan, Mickey Mantle, and a bajillion other baseball legends played at least a few games at Fenway Park.,The Washington Redskins played here before they ended up in Washington. The indianapolis Colts played here in the 40's. FDR spoke at Fenway. Last season, Fenway Park was temporarily deemed a federal court house, and 3000+ people became citizens within the park. ,Bruce Springsteen, Jimmy Buffett, the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, and Neil Diamond have performed at Fenway. ,Parts of Field of Dreams was filmed here, as were Little Big League, and Fever Pitch(though, that's not a thing of pride to admit),For the most part, you know what you're gonna get. High priced beer, hot dogs that aren't *that* great, and a bag of peanuts for $4. It's okay, splurge. You're sitting in one of the greatest places where history is frozen in time."
"I have mixed feelings about San Francisco City Hall.  My gut reaction is to despise it because I don't particularly like its architecture.  But I've lived in San Francisco for a few years now, and although I still don't really like how the building looks, I'm glad it's as large as it is and that it's in such a prominent place.  Basically, City Hall looks about right for the importance of San Francisco relative to the state, the country, and the world.  ,I often ride the 21-Hayes right next to City Hall, and tourists inevitably ask what the beautiful building is.  I'm always proud to say it's City Hall.  I've had quite a few tourists ask me whether it's the California state capitol.  See, San Francisco is cool like that.  We're only the fourth most populous city in the state (after L.A., San Diego, and San Jose [!]), but we don't feel like it.  I'm more partial to L.A.'s city hall, but San Francisco's is perfectly located amid some pretty important institutions.,Inside, it's an interesting building.  It would be neat to see a wedding here.  The second floor hallways feel like an old elementary school, but the entire first floor is interesting in a marble kind of way.  It's definitely worth a visit."
"Loved my visit to Independence Hall! I'm a bit of an American history nerd, and it's great to see such a wonderfully preserved monument to the birth of this nation. Note that you have to have a timed ticket (free) from the visitor center across the street from the Liberty Bell, but other than that, there was a quick security screening and we were on our way. Our guide was fantastic, and gave a great overview of the historic context and the history of Independence Hall itself.,Once we were inside the building, each room was described and our guide pointed out what was reproduction, restoration, or original. The guide provided plenty of time for pictures, and was happy to answer any questions during or after the tour.,Only 30 minutes, but whether you're a citizen or a visitor, it's a fantastic look back on a very important spot."
"You go for the experience, for sure and for even a moderate baseball fan like me, this is a must-visit stadium.  On a weeknight game (admittedly now a few years ago), it was insanely packed, with even the standing room only sections filled with people.  I don't think there's any opportunity for last-minute, cheap tickets, so plan ahead, or be prepared to shell out $$ for the game from a scalper.  Tons of energy during the game, and great people watching all the crazy fans. The area around the park was fun too - it reminded me of a huge festival or state fair.  A great ballpark and experience for sure!"
"I am speechless, must see if you are in Boston."
"I went to Fenway for my first time yesterday! I am 24 and live close by but have never had the chance to go to a game. I don't even follow sports, just wanted to check it out. I cannot say enough great things about Fenway. We had an amazing time. We had a great view, some snacks, and the Red Sox won!! I would recommend going here to anyone, even if you aren't a fan of sports. The beer and food are obviously overpriced, but that is expected. A beer is 8ish and a cup of wine was 7.50$ I believe, a hot dog was 5$ peanuts - lemonade - and pretzels were all around 4.50. The concession guys running around don't give change so it rounds up. Overall, it was amazing!!"
"The idea that Fenway Park is a thing of beauty is one of those notions that seems to have become sacred. All the more reason to finally dispense with it. I follow baseball avidly, but I'm no purist. Nothing lasts forever, and this park is due to be taken down and turned into a museum. I'm very glad that I've managed to go five times, but the seats are designed for the tiny malnourished people of another era, and the sightlines are as bad as they say. Paying scalpers three times face value for tickets is no pleasure either; I wonder how the gal who claims that ""there are tickets to meet any budget"" got hers. Going in as an opposing team's fan is not a friendly experience, though still a lot better than Citizens Bank Park. The real pleasures of the stadium are the walkable location, the uniform brick, and the very nice workers.,BTW, purists should be required to watch this:"
"Like the muslims on a pilgrimage Mecca, I was in awe when I arrived at Fenway.  I stopped and though about all of the sacred high priests who donned their uni's and played on this hallowed field...Cy Young, Babe Ruth, Jimmy Collins, Duffy Lewis, Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper, Joe Cronin, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky, Ted Williams, Jimmie Foxx, Carlton Fisk, Jim Rice and Carl Yastrzemski, to name just a few.  I then dropped to my knees and in prayerful reverie gave thanks to General Charles Henry Taylor for building the greatest baseball stadium on earth.   In what can only be termed a processional, my family and I then followed the masses into the bowels of the shrine and proceeded to find our seats.   ,My wife (I love her with all my heart), was lucky enough to snag 4 seats through a vendor at her job.  Did I happen to mention that these seats were directly on the Red Sox's dugout?  If there is a heaven, It is probably located in fieldbox #23.  The view was dazzling...in front of me, the Green Monstah and to my right Pesky's pole and the Red seat.  Surrounding me, awash in a dazzling array of red, white and blue were the men, women and children known as RED SOX NATION.   Now, I am a Phillies fan and have been to many games at the Vet and at Citizens but I have never seen the dedication and devotion that the Sox inspire in their fans.  ,Now, onto the review...,The stadium is very old.  The seats are very small and the concourse level underneath the stadium is not nearly large enough to accomodate the 30,000+ fans that flock here every game.  To be expected, beer and food prices are outrageous.  But then again, theyre outrageous at EVERY major sporting stadium.   Fenway is not about the food or the beer, its about the experience.  Go outside and walk Yawkey way before, during and after the game and it's like a block party...live music, food and souvenir vendors, fansof every age, color, race and religion all getting together to celebrate the Sox.  In one word...electric.  ,If you really want to explore Fenway, take one of the guided tours (tahs) they offer every day.  Its cheap ($17.00 with a discout coupon that we got in our hotel) and its informative.  The guides take you through the bleachers, on top of the Green Monster (ah) into the press box, the scorekeepers room and through the locker rooms.  You can touch Pesky's pole, sit in the Red seat and learn about Duffy's Cliff.  ,WARNING:  Don't try and drive to the stadium unless you don't mind paying upwards of $60.00 to park.  Parking is at a premium in downtown Boston and the spaces are limited.   Take a cab, use public transportation, or if you are staying close enough, just walk.   There are also guys on bike coaches that will take you to the game, chat you up a bit during the ride and charge you whatever you want to pay...yes, whatever you feel the ride was worth is what you pay.   Be nice and be generous though, as most the the riders are college kids trying to make money for the fall semester.  ,Back to the game...The Sox lost (boo) and I was not a happy camper about that, however, I will never forget the look on my daughter's face when she got not one, not two, not three, but four, count em' four game balls from the following:  Dustin, Youk, Jacoby and Terry Francona.  Dustin gave her a game ball when he came off the field right before the game...he pointed at her and just rolled the ball on the top of the dugout right to her.   Youk gave her a ball when he came in after the first inning.  Papi dribbled a foul ball into the dugout and Francona scooped it up, looked over the dugout, pointed at my daughter and rolled her another one.  NOTE:  It helps to get alot of game balls when your daughter is the only child sitting on the dugout.  The last game ball came from Ellsbury.  He made an amazing, leaping catch to end an inning and when he came in he tossed it right to her.   I wonder if someday, she'll look at those balls and remember her night in heaven."
"Watch out, 'cause this is the enthusiasm bug's natural environment. Oh, lordy, I'm still palpitatin' from FP. ,Not only was the game _awesome_ but a fight almost broke out behind me! No, not over me, just in the row directly behind me. ,I have been indoctrinated now. I am now one of you. Give me my red and white uniform."
It's Fenway. We got to look  around and take pictures for free on Father's Day. 5 stars
"I went to Fenway to watch a Yankees-Red Sox game with my girlfriend and, although I am a Yankees fan, I believe this great atmosphere for a baseball game. However, Fenway was not as raucous as Yankee Stadium not as raucous as I expected--probably because of the current winning percentage for the Red Sox.,My experience at Fenway was great--my girlfriend and I weren't harassed because I am a Yankees fan (a great fear of mine before I purchased the tickets) or wore Yankees gear to the stadium. Furthermore, for a ballpark kept around for 100 years, I must say that the stadium was very well kept and clean--something I couldn't say about the old Yankee Stadium.,Thumbs Up for Fenway. An old school park and an old school experience. A living landmark in the heart of Boston."
"If you haven't been to Fenway, go!,If your ass takes up more than your share of real estate... you're not gonna have an awesome time, the seats are as narrow as possible.,Learn about baseball, see some history, talk to your neighbor about the game. Take it all in, this is Fenway, and this is one of the parks left that has some real character to it!"
Awesome! A Boston institution. A must see when in Boston!
"How can you review Fenway Park? You can't. It's too perfect. Not a bad seat, unless you're behind a support pole. But no matter where you sit it's all good. Fenway Frank was great. Get it! The closed off streets around the ballpark before the game are fantastically active with music, man on stilts, food vendors, sports shops, drinks, a million places to take pictures, and all out fun. History galore around and inside the park. Get there early and have a memorable time. But don't take the car. The train or bus are the way to go. But they will be crazy crowded if you stay until the last out. So, plan on a trip to Fenway Pahk to see your favorite team play the Red Sox. My team, NY Yankees, took 3 out of 4 the weekend I was there. Yeah, Fenway is just about perfect in every way. GO THERE!!!"
"This place is beautiful and the people working in there are even more wonderful. They're very helpful and nice!,I've been here for many occasions, 3 times for weddings, once for my own engagement photos, and once to get my address and voters information switched over.,For engagement/wedding photos I recommend coming in at the evening- it's super quiet and empty. The bathrooms are cleaned and empty for your use to change or touch up make up.. and the guards in front are so nice and are so happy to see you! :D Thank you!"
"This is hands down, the most beautiful library I've ever been to. There's so many books and it's massive, so there's a lot of quiet areas for you to either read or study,The ONLY bad thing I can think about this library is that it doesn't have a used bookstore. A lot of libraries in San Diego (where I'm from) have a used bookstore and I was surprised that the main library in America's 2nd biggest city doesn't have one,However, there's a used bookstore a couple of blocks down the street from here called ""The Last Bookstore."" It's awesome (search it on Yelp and you'll find my review) but I think it would be cool if this library has a used bookstore.,Other than that minor complaint, I think this library is wonderful and it's one of the wisest ways our government is spending our tax dollars."
"What can I say, Boston is the kind of place that we never want to leave when we visit. Fenway Park is the same way. The charge and excitement in the ballpark is electric regardless of who the Sox are playing. Get there early and take a tour then walk around the outside of the ballpark and feel the history come to life. Once the gates open head out to Yawkey Way and grab a Fenway Frank and a cold beer and take in the sights and sounds. While mingling with fellow baseball and Sox fans and hearing where they are from and other parks they have visited you will find the same opinion over and over ""Fenway is the best!"""
"I'm not a Red Sox fan, but there is no better place to watch an MLB game with the exception of possible Wrigley Field.  The combination of the unique structure of the Green Monster and the storied history of the BoSox make attending a game at Fenway an unforgettable experience.  Nuff said."
"This is one of the ballparks that is a must see for any baseball fan. Except for the fact that it's an American League ballpark, this is baseball at it's purest. Everyone, and I repeat EVERYONE, in this ballpark is a die hard, knowledgeable fan. I don't think I saw a single person there just to be there - patrons were genuinely there to watch baseball, which is so unlike the situation at a lot of modern parks. You can turn to virtually anyone sitting near you and have a 15 minute discussion about the latest bullpen addition, who should be sent down to the minors, and about how much the Yankees suck. And they boo fans who fail to catch foul balls.,The ballpark itself is old, no getting around it. Lots of seats have obstructed views and the concourse is narrow. The field is iconic, with the Big Green Monster in left and the oddly angled right field wall. Good roaming vendors (love the hot dogs) and they'll even let you bring in food from outside - my brother and I both got an italian sausage from the vendor out on the street.,I loved my experience here, and I hope I get to see it again someday - preferably in interleague play with the Cubs visiting!"
"Visually awesome!!!!,My BF's grandmother passed away and she was given a memorial here.,It was a perfect place for the occasion.,I was told that all kinds of celebrations like weddings are held here all the time.,In life there are times to laugh and there are times to cry- ,Anyways, her life was celebrated- she was an awesome person!!!!!,Everything was prepared and cleaned up in a timely fashion - staff was helpful.,With everthing going so smoothly it helped to make going through this occasion just a little bit more easier....."
"Isn't there like 2 floors above ground and four below?!? ,Books, books, and more books. Great computer lab. Literacy center. Awesome rotating art exhibitions. Amazing free lectures at the Mark Taper Auditorium.,I could live here and I am jealous of all of the homeless people that do."
"Love this place!,Such a huge place, and very spacious inside. The architecture inside and outside is amazing, especially the rotunda's interior.,I noticed there was a WIDE collection of books as well no matter what genre you're looking for.,The cafe in this place looked to be rather peaceful as well, so it's nice to come in there to study, sip your coffee, and enjoy your snacks altogether.,The staff seemed very friendly as well.,I also liked the little courtyard type place on Flower Street as well. Very artistic.,Only bad thing is that I don't live that close to this library for me to visit it every day or every week. If I did, I'd definitely make this my second home or something."
"If you want to appreciate the art deco-ness of the Los Angeles Public Library Main Branch, look up. The cloudy ceilings of the Caesars Palace Forum Shops at Las Vegas have nothing on their art deco ceiling.,But Third Floor Literature is where each of the five stars go to. If you want to be reassured that Los Angeles has a trickle of literary awareness, go here. This is where I troll with or without my card. Almost everything I want is contained here. Sometimes things spill over into Fourth Floor, but Floor Three is where it's at. You can find me in a cubby hole of one of their many desks. It also takes five minutes on average to retrieve a book from their secret guarded cave that half of their selection is in. ,The ground level and most of the non-library is still foreign to me. Their ground-level bathroom is the bane of existence and reminds me of pooping at the public bathroom in Washington Square Park in New York without seat cover and placed along a row of other stainless steel toilets not looking at anyone else do their business. If 'musty' could be where my description for their bathroom ends, I wouldn't even think twice about mentioning it. I think of Jean Genet writing about isolation in prison.,Since many of the people who come here do not have home addresses, they are very very strict about card regulations for checking out books. When I first moved here, I had to give proof of my address through a paper bill (digital copies from iPhones are prohibited). ,As I waited to check in a book that I cannot check back in from their computers, I thought to myself as I waited on a long line full of people, ""these people in front of me carrying stacks of three books upwards look like they had never read one book before."" Then I realized that they were hardcore business law books to contrast with my wispy lit criticism.,Still so much I don't know about this library."
"Hard earned city tax dollars at work in allowing our elected officials to do what they do best.  And thats making San Francisco a city where we can be safe, live, play, and earn."
"Yes, you'll probably have an uncomfortable seat. Yes, you'll probably have an obstructed view. No, you can't get close to the field during the game. Yes, you'll have to pay an arm and a leg to get in and get fed... But it's Fenway. Next to Wrigley, is there a better, old-school ballpark to see a game?,P.S. The best (affordable) seats are on the roof."
"The BEST!! Night games are fantastic -- the lights, the uniforms look amazing! What an experience. If you have not been, then go!"
"I am a Yankees fan and this was my first time to Fenway. I thought the stadium was beautiful, it felt really classy. We sat almost in the front row for a minor league game and it was fantastic. The stadium itself is shaped a little bit differently in comparison to the Yankee and Mets stadiums.,Overall, Boston fans are die-hard fans and both New Yorkers and Bostonians have the same love of the game. Long live Fenway. I only wish I had a shot to see the Yanks play the Red Sox here. ;-P"
"This is where the Mr and I got our marriage certificate and had an intimate ceremony while saving up for a real ceremony and reception later on (still pending). The building itself on the outside isn't much and you could be sure to find a few homeless wandering about. But once you're inside, the main hall is beautiful, has high ceilings and an elegant stair case. The architecture is really beautiful overall, and it makes for great wedding photos. I actually have a high school friend who's mom is one of the marrying officiants here, although some other lady performed our ceremony. It's a much nicer city hall than some others I've seen in the bay."
A great tour and worth a visit. Tickets were sold out online but I was able to obtain a ticket by walking to the visitor center (they sell 40% of daily tickets online and the rest are for walk ups). When I got there at 9:15 I was able to get a 9:45 tour. Earlier to show up is better as when I was done I walked into liberty bell center but when I came back later I the afternoon the line was out the door and a decent wait to get into liberty bell center.
"We came to Fenway for a Yankees-Red Sox game a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed ourselves. Of course, as a native of southern Connecticut, it was particularly enjoyable to watch the Yankees win, but politics aside, the stadium was great and the experience totally worth the somewhat hefty price tag. ,The game we attended was a Saturday matinee: it was actually rescheduled from late April, when it had been rained out (the original game was cancelled well before we were planning to go over to the ballpark, which was nice). We'd bought the tickets a couple of months in advance from the original April date via Stub Hub, although I don't think there's a real need to do that: it looks like prices are constant regardless of when you buy. If you want to be safe, I wouldn't wait until the day before the game to buy your tickets (although you might get a better deal if you do that), but it didn't seem like buying way ahead of the game was that beneficial.,We took the T into Boston, which I highly recommend: parking can cost  you an arm and a leg (think $35+). Gates for weekend games open two hours early, and we got there right around the opening time, which wasn't really necessary, although it was pretty cool to see the park almost empty and watch it slowly fill up. In the future, I probably won't bother getting to the game any earlier than about an hour to and hour and a half before it starts. Still, it was nice to be able to walk around the park and scope out dining options before the interior got too nuts. There are also a number of exhibits about the history of the stadium which are harder to really give much attention when the place is busy.,Speaking of food--the options aren't the best I've seen. I suppose one of the negatives about a historic park is that it's not going to necessarily have the hippest dining venues in baseball (a la the Citi Field Shake Shack). There are some unusual options, including sushi, though I'm personally pretty happy with a regular old hot dog and some soft serve when I go to a baseball game. I do wish they had a map of where to find beer though. If you're looking for something other than Bud Light, they have a number of options (including Guinness and Blue Moon Pale Ale), but they're spread out throughout the park, so it's a bit of a scavenger hunt to find them. Yes, prices are rather high for what you're getting, but that's kind of to be expected. Do bring your own water bottle--if you have a sealed disposable one you're allowed to bring it into the stadium with you and it will probably be cheaper than what they charge ($2+).,We sat in the Right Field Roof Box, which I really liked. The seats are pretty high up, so we didn't feel quite as close to the game as grandstand seats would have put us, but we had a great view of the whole field, as well as the Boston skyline. For this area, which row you're in really doesn't matter: the seats are steep enough that you're not going to be blocked by someone in front of you. I also loved the fact that the box feels pretty private: it's a bit out of the way, so you don't have people constantly going by. If that hasn't sold you on the seats, there's also a bar associated with the area which is much quieter than the main food areas.  Overall, I'd definitely consider sitting here again: it made the crowded stadium feel much less chaotic."
"Came here on Friday for the Jason Aldean concert!  ,Though the lines were long and the place was packed, it was generally staffed with nice people.,And, I appreciated security being mindful of ""ticket integrity"", a term I'll throw together to explain that they did a good job of making sure the people with 50 dollar seats, didn't creep up into my 4th row center seat area, and obstructing the view of those who paid a premium.,Awesome!"
"""Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, welcome to Fenway Park, America's most beloved ballpark."",Music to my ears.,I've had the distinct pleasure of going to Red Sox games at least twice a season.  Fenway Park is a sports venue like no other.  The fans, the fun, the food... oh, and the baseball is pretty good too.,Yes, the food is overpriced.  Yes, the seats are tiny and hard.  That's why I love standing room.  There are so many places to get food beforehand outside the park (and not just the BIG few right next to it, if you're really concerned about food price you can find a restaurant and reasonable food no problem).,Added bonus - they now have a lot more vegetarian options - veggie burritos, veggie burgers, veggie franks (by far the best veggie dog I've ever consumed.),Happy 100, Fenway.  Here's to 100 more!"
"I like the Red Sox but Fenway Park has outgrown its self. Something has to be done with the currant situation.  With so many sox fans, and fewer seats, compaired to other ball clubs, Fenway has to raise its prices on all seats just to break even. ,I suggest building a new Super Fenway Park with seating for couple of hundred thousand jillion. With lots of parking too!,Maybe use the old park for concerts or build a massive baseball museum?"
"Yes.  It is baseball, and yes it is worth it.  ,Hours and hours online, larger $ for seats, Fenway on a sunny Sunday afternoon playing a team I don't like much, beer, food, walkabout outside and inside (as allowed!) with a foul ball hitting the crossbar over our heads was near perfection.  One seat away from perfection with(out) a foul ball."
"Being that this is the first and only baseball park I've been to, it really is as good as it gets. I took in the whole experience. The shopping, the eating (Fenway Franks of course), and watching the Sox play. It was very easy to get into the park, as they have scanners to scan your tickets quickly. Getting out was equally efficient. Good flow of people traffic. Be prepared to pay a lot for a little. But, it's part of the experience. I would never purchase a hot dog for almost $6. But if you're going to do Fenway, you've got to pay up, which I imagine is the same at other parks across the country. There's nothing like the view of the Green Monster though, anywhere else."
"Fenway is my happy place. ,Over the years they've done SO much to preserve AND improve the park: more concessions, new seating, HD jumbo tron/video boards, keeping yawkey way open, new/clean restrooms... i could go on. Do some of the seats stink? you bet!! but you can hardly blame fenway b/c people are so much bigger now compared to 1912 & don't fit in the seats anymore.,the newer parks are just that - new. I'll take historic, Friendly Fenway any day!,Check out the improvements yourself at:"
"Fenway Park is absolutely my favorite place in Boston, from the moment you walk in, you're in for a good time..the lines for beer can be pretty long(obviously you're in Boston, and everybody loves beer)..but it's well worth the wait since you can get 2 at a time, perfect for couples, families, kids, tourists, everyone is welcome and on top of that you get to watch the Sox, always a good time!!"
"This is a review for a weekend wedding ceremony 2hr block.,Go figure that the venue is going to be a rather difficult place to work with because it is city own property. ,When looking at venues for our ceremony, we thought that this would be the perfect place for it. We placed a hold on it with a deposit and come time that we paid the remaining deposit, an additional 300 dollar restoration fee was added. There was no conversation about this in the beginning and we were actually surprised that it showed up. Obviously we wouldn't cancel the venue because everyone already knew that our wedding ceremony was going to be there.,FYI, this didn't really bother me but it was kind of expected. There are a lot of things that city hall does not allow. If things are not allowed on the contract and you don't see whether your specific detail of your wedding  is allowed, make sure you ask! ,Vendors- only vendors with liability insurance are allowed. This basically wipes out a good portion of vendors out there. Make sure you ask the vendors if they have insurance.,Lastly, the one thing that did annoy me the most was on the wedding day. We were standing in front of the main entrance of city hall waiting to get in.  We could even see people standing inside however a little past our designated time schedule, they didn't even bother to tell us that we (the wedding party) and ALL our guests need to enter at the side of the building where the loading dock was. I had elderly guests that they wanted to send around the corner to enter the building. We argued with them for that because my 80+ year old grandparents already spent so much time walking to the venue that we did not want them to walk around the building to get in. That ate into the time that we were scheduled for building use and they are strict with the 2 hr time block.,Otherwise, the three stars awarded was purely for the beauty of the building. I can't say that the operations of this building was exactly what I had in mind. More troublesome to work with. According to my wedding coordinator, they were a hit and miss with communication. There was a break in communication for myself since I was informed that my point of contact no longer worked there. I found out 2 weeks after no communication from city hall that she left employment there. ,City hall is just a beautiful building without decorations. That was the best part because we hardly needed any decorations for this place.,If you decide to select this place for your event, weigh out your options before committing. For me It was worth it because I wanted to get married here. For others, the hassle may not be worth it. p.s. Book early if you want the 1-3pm ceremony slot on Saturdays, those book out fast."
"Beautiful and enormous!,The process for obtaining a library card was quick and painless, easily under a minute. I also preregistered for my card online at home so I didn't have to spend time filling anything out at the counter.,It's been years since I've been here, and the last time was to attend a special event. My intention was simply to register so I could download e-books. Today I left with three books and a set of audio recordings for language acquisition! (nerding out for a moment here),The librarians were super helpful. Parking was easy but $5 for staying over an hour with a library validation. I don't know the max price for parking because I left after about 90 minutes."
"I'm a Dodger fan... but FENWAY is dope! I went to the 4/17/11 Red Sox vs. Blue Jays game at noon. ,Things I loved: Sweet Caroline song, Green Monster, Amazing selection of food (I got the Steak and Cheese), free refills w/ souvenir cup, 10 commandments of Fenway (rules that made sure people weren't jerks),Things I didn't love: Tickets cost 4x the cost of Dodgers/Yankees/Mets tickets.,Outside of the cost of attending a game, this place is a must-visit for all baseball fans. The fan atmosphere was very pleasant; fans were enthusiastic, but not jerks to the away team. I like how there were fan shops and sports bars all around the park. It was also very cool to see kids allowed to run around the bases after the game. This is my favorite ballpark thus far."
"Fenway as a Yankee fan, I have mixed feelings about you.,I don't like those guys that play on your field,but as a ballpark I love you.,You are old, and still have that 'good old days baseball atmosphere'. ,You seats are small, but again I am happy to get a seat when the Pinstripes are in Boston. ,I enjoyed being there that day when the Yankees beat the Red Sox. I hope one day to be able to return and again enjoy a great day in Fenway, who knows after this season, the Bronx Bombers are able to give you a spankin' in your own house."
It's Fenway Park. Done.
It's Fenway Park! Just wish the seats were designed for a modern-sized homo sapien.
beware: parking is always difficult
This is super heartbreaking to write because I am such a fan or libraries and books and basically grew up in a library. Today was the third time I used the library and the homeless population is just so prominent and makes the experience unworkable. The moment I walked into the second floor art floor I was confronted by a man being dragged out. The smell was so intense. I then sat down in a cubicle and was being oogled by a man that was clearly homeless and making totally inappropriate gestures towards me. Trust me it makes me feel like a jerk to even write this but I have noticed a GIANT handfull of other comments about this same issue.
"The Central library is one of the best. It's huge, beautiful to walk through, and even has it's own library store filled with a lot of cool items. ,If you are looking for a book on anything, it's most likely already at the Central branch. It's great to find a book, find a chair, and read quietly for a while. If you want to do research, they have lots of free computers to use or you can bring your laptop and take advantage of the free wifi in there. ,I love the small park outside of it and there are restaurant options outside of it too. You can go upscale with Cafe Pinot or settle for Panda Express inside."
This is my favorite place in downtown to spend my days off. The architecture is BEAUTIFUL and there is a calming/peaceful vibe inside. There are many floors and a plethora of options for material. I love that they offer reading classes to adults. The park in front is also beautiful and the sound of the fountains is incredibly relaxing. Good cafe on the first floor for snacks!
My friend got her wedding ceremony here. Love the architect!
"my sister decided to have her 'low key' nuptials at the drop dead gorgeous city hall.  the venue is gorgeous -- possibly the most beautiful public building I've ever been in.  Bernice, her officiant, was just a darling, made us all cry, and added a touch of nostalgic traditional to the day. ,3 things -- 1) they tell you to be on time for your appts, which you should be, because how else would you have all that time to wait around.  2) they also tell you a max of 6 guests, but I think that unless you bus in Party Central, no one is going to stop aunt susan and uncle ed from being around. 3) bring a camera, a camcorder, a photographer, because you'll want those pics for a lifetime."
"I saw the best ballgame ever here it was the redsox vs. yankees game........well almost the best cause the yankees won (boooooo),although the seats are small and your knees might hit someone behind the head there is so much history here, there is the green monster here, it seems like every seat you have a fantastic view.,I love this place not to mention its right near Landsdown street.......SAVE FENWAY PARK"
"There is just something about walking into a historic ballpark, making your way in from the street, through the dark and crowded concourse under the seats, then up the walkway, until you burst out from the darkness into the bright green expanse of the field.  Every time I do it, I get chills.  There are plenty of good places to see a game, but very few great places, and Fenway is one of them."
"Who doesn't love Fenway?  It may be over priced (what baseball stadium isn't?), but no matter where you sit you have a great view.  With the Sox being so bad this year, tickets are affordable - so I can handle the $8.50 for a beer."
"So good!  So good!  So good!,Fenway is to watching baseball Games, as record players are to listening to music.  It's functional, has character and history, and sometimes needs expensive repairs.,I have a grand old time there, despite it's age, uncomfortable seating, and obstructed views.  Don't get me wrong, if they ever renovate Fenway and take away all those charming qualities Bostonians love so much, I will join the masses in tipping over cars and setting Kenmore Square on fire (if you knew me, you would know that this is not typical behavior).  Anything you eat or drink in the park will cost you upwards of seven million dollars (seemingly), but there's just something about ballgames and munching/drinking that feels so right.  Bring lots of cash, and don't underestimate the speed of the yellow-shirted Aramark boys, or you can kiss your $4.75 soft pretzel goodbye."
"This is where Gavin Newsom works. He has a nice building, eh? My friggin' office is an ice box 5 stories above the ground in the Mission {grumble} ...,Anywho, all office building envy aside, this is a pretty City Hall. I like the dome, it adds a little architectural distinction (because, I mean, how many buildings have ever had DOMES on them, eh?!). We're pretty lucky to have this building in SF."
"I wasn't sure about this visit because I grew up around Williamsburg so I have high standards for historical places. You have to go to the visitors center to get a free timed ticket. Here's a hint I was traveling alone for business so I only needed 1 ticket. However, I arrived a half hour early, and they were able to fit me on an earlier tour. You have to go through a security bag check so leave plenty of time if it's a busy day. They take you into a room with modern seats at first to give an overview of the era. I was worried because I found this part hard to follow. However, once we went to the hall the tour guide, Matthew, did an amazing job interpreting about the time period and objects in the room. He did a nice job anticipating our questions that we would ask. For example he went through what they knew about placement of things in the room and then other items of interest. We wrapped up the whole visit in 30 minutes. It was a nice quick visit into the past."
"An old classic - easy in, easy out.,Just user-friendly, great views (Boston has many of these).,Saw Neil Diamond here for an historic concert. Biggest issue was the acoustics were a little muffled. Either way - an experience not to be missed!"
"Is it possible to write an unbiased review for a place like Fenway Park? I don't know. It certainly isn't for someone like me. ,To me, walking into Fenway is like walking into a mythical land of my childhood. Those gates are like stumbling through a wardrobe into Narnia, taking a tornado ride to Oz, or being teleported onto the Enterprise. It's a world that only lives on television, where anything can happen, sometimes good, often terrible, but always full of hope, even in times of tragedy.,It's a magical, impossible world, until the first time you actually walk up those stairs and see the field open up in front of you. Sure, the seats are small and uncomfortable, and the food is overpriced, and you'll either be freezing or roasting and probably looking at a pillar when something important is going on, but it doesn't matter to me. It's not the best park in the world in any objective sense. There are a lot of improvements (food, price, seats, viewing angle, etc.) you could find at any number of other, younger parks.  But from my perspective, Fenway will always be the park that feels like home."
"I always feel like I'm walking into a dream that I never want to wake up from when I go to Fenway.  It's amazing.  I love it.  Who doesn't love it.. seriously.  If you don't, you don't belong. End of story."
"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BALLPARK IN THE WORLD.,On Fathers' Day, 2007 I was there with my parents and my Aunt Betty because we were nearby-ish anyway. We figured we wouldn't get in, but we thought that soaking up the atmosphere pre-game was better than nothing. It was the Giants and Barry Bonds was doing his stupid, usual  home-run thing. He got one. Mercifully, it was one of his last ones and it was his final season, it turned out. The fans booed mightily after he hit one into the Monster. It was also tossed back onto the field. Rightly so.,We thought we might buy tickets from a scalper but they were too expensive. But I had a brainstorm and thought, Let me just see what's up. Let me just go talk to someone in a ticket booth. The fam thought I was crazy. But lo & behold, there were some tix available. Apparently they were either season-ticket holders' tickets or unsold ones returned by ticket brokers or something, and there were some available for purchase. Apparently, these come up for-sale kind-of last-minute. We had to wait in a short line, but then we paid only face value and sat in the right field bleacher seats, field level, lookin' straight at J.D. Drew's ass. $35 a pop and one of the greatest days of my life. The Red Sox won. And a few months later, they won the World Series (again)! ,I will never forget the crowd chanting as one, ""Let's go, Red Sox!"" and ""Sweet Caroline"" playing late in the game. Even better though was the 2 little boys next to me, with their dad--they  shouted, ""Ret's go Red Sox!"" To this day, I still say, ""Ret's go, Red Sox!"" from time-to-time.,Mind you, spilling my secret method of scoring decent face-value Red Sox tickets isn't easy."
$30 to park. $60 to eat luckily the tix were free. Atleast they won breaking a 6 game losing streak when I go.
"Finally got to see Fenway Park. Not much to say but saw a great game, had a great hotdog and met some great fans!! :)"
"I have been to Wrigley.  Been to the House that Ruth Built.  Grew up with the Dodgers, taking in games under the palm trees at Chavez Ravine.  I've seen the faux fountain at Angel Stadium, been to Pac Bell with that view of the water.  I have been to games in San Diego and other places with nice ballparks.,But Fenway is number one in my book.  It's got atmosphere, electricity and fans to back up the hype.  Going to a game at Fenway is more than just going to a ball game.  As much as I love the Dodgers and will always be their fan first and foremost, Fenway is my favourite place to catch a game.  Wrigley is a close second."
"Made a trip to Boston back in May of this year and the one must see attraction for us was Fenway Park.  We lucked out and the Cleveland Indians were playing in town and managed to see a game plus tour the ballpark.  Do yourself a favor and take the  guided tour.  The tour guide was great and we got a real history tour of the park.  We got to see and sit atop the ""Green Monster"", see where Ted Williams moon shot home run landed in right field - just great and a not to be missed attraction while in Boston. When you watch a game in this stadium you really feel like you have stepped back in time.  Being a lifelong Red Sox fan winning the World Series this year made our trip that more special."
"I didn't actually go inside, but the outside looks beautiful. I think I will be going to the park/field next time I go. I went to their store and the neighborhood is beautiful, people are friendly :)"
"I finally made a trip to another major league ballpark outside of New York and what better way to experience another ballpark than to visit Fenway Park. Fenway Park is every bit as historic as the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and in 2012, it is the 100th anniversary of its opening. Surprisingly, after going through the gates, I felt that it was a bit cleaner than the old Yankee Stadium. Maybe it was because Yankee maintenance had become an afterthought when they knew a new Yankee Stadium was going to be built. But I digress. Fenway is painted in the marine green that we are all familiar with and stepping inside, there is a great blend of new and old. A huge, high-definition screen is mounted above center field. Most of the seats, from what I can tell from the right field boxes were well maintained - not much peeling paint to be seen. Ironically, this trip to Fenway was to see a hockey game. If you ever come to Fenway for a hockey game, definitely go to the higher levels, you won't see a thing at field level, which was where we were. ,As for concessions and bathrooms, everything appeared to be clean, well-lit and friendly. One item that caught my eye was a memorabilia case on the first level with jerseys, ticket stubs and other really interesting items. ,As for customer service at the stadium, ushers at the stadium were fairly helpful. We had to ask at least 4 ushers to find our seats. The numbering system on the tickets and in the stadium was really confusing, but luckily we were pointed generally in the right direction. I was left with the impression that the ushers don't even know their own seating system!,Finally, although the double-header college hockey match we saw was a sellout, we were surprised that transportation on the green line, Kenmore Station, didn't produce massive overcrowding on the platforms, even though most train lines that go through Kenmore, only have 1 or 2 cars. We only had to wait for 3 trains to pass by before we were able to board a train. My guess is that most visitors to Fenway take their cars."
"SF City Hall is beautiful. It's a great place to take photos, get married, or just explore history. They offer tours of City Hall throughout the week, just check with the desk in the lobby for current schedules."
"I love this library, mainly because it's huge and they have a large collection of books. I wish I could give it all 5 stars, but my big complaints are that the past few times that I have been there I have been approached by a couple hostile bums as I walk up the the McGuire Garden pathway way, most of then asking for money, and when I tell them I don't have any money, they get all rude and mean. I just wish there was a bit more security for that. Also, the bathrooms inside the library are disgusting. So I usually make my trips to the library as fast as possible, and I rather use the bathrooms at the Westin. Other then that, I love this library because it's like a mall for just books."
"I witnessed my own re-birth last friday as a baseball loving Fenway fan. Some history to underline the importance of this event in my life. Never followed a baseball game and first timer at Fenway. OMG!!! It ,r-o-c-k-e-d my world. Try out everything, the beers, icecream, popcorn, cottoncandies. PS :Big PAPI i love you!!!"
Don't like baseball but very cool experience!
"May of 2006.  My trip to baseball Mecca.  ,My buddy and I were outside Fenway during a Yankee-Red Sox game right before Memorial Day weekend.  Tickets of course were sold out and many scalpers scattered about were selling tickets at extremely inflated prices.  He wasn't feeling the game, but to me this was a must event.  Yankees, Sox, Fenway Park.  I live in Cali, but I had no idea if or when I would ever visit Beantown again.  Bucket list moment.,I finally convinced him of the significance of this endeavor.  We ended up paying $100 for 2 outfield seats.  ,The seats didn't work for me.  Very, very small and not very comfortable.  If you are under 5'5"" you are OK.  I am 6'2"".,The most ardent baseball fans I have ever been around.  Knowledgeable, crude, obnoxious.  Love 'em.  I even witnessed a fight between a Yankee and Red Sox fan.  Sweet!,Face value for tickets: $23 a piece.  ,Fried Dough: $8,Walking to the grandstand and seeing the Green Monsta, the scoreboard, ManRam, Big Papi, and saying to myself, ""This is the place where the Splendid Splinter and Carlton Fisk made history"":  Priceless.,PS.....While writing this review, I developed a man sized hunger for fried dough.  Can someone mail me some?"
"Really beautiful building, inside and out. I didn't realize how many people actually got married there, but now I can understand why. ,Aside from the kind of rundown atmosphere that you get from the surroundings outside; this would be a great place to spend to spend a day exploring and learning about the history."
"favorite library forever and ever. :),i try to get my books, cds, audio books, dvds transferred here so i can spend more time in here. :)"
"They have drive up drop boxes on 5th Street! So convienient!  I was afraid I'd have to pay parking just to drop off my books but thank goodness I can stay in the comfort of my air-conditioned car. These boxes are available 24/7 so even though the library is sleeping, you can still return, worry-free!"
"This is easily one of the better libraries I have been to. Fellow readers: This may just be heaven! ,My concerns with this place: ,1. Holds could be processed a bit faster;,2. It could smell a bit nicer, especially on the main lobby level;,3. I've come close to being smacked in the side of my face by flying birds on several occasions while just walking in and out. Visitors beware.,An easy five stars otherwise, because they have some excellent collections here which often make just browsing for content immense fun."
"Which BART station do you get off at to go to City Hall?,Are you retarded? Civic center !?,I would recommend going on a weekday while people are at work at take the tour. The building is stunning and has such a rich history. ,If you've got money to burn I would recommend this place to throw a party or wedding since apparently you can rent it for like 10k a night.,I always see couples getting married here. If you're going to choose any city hall in California to get married in, this is probably the one to do it in. Sorry, Fresno."
"there is nothing better than seeing a game here!,there just isn't.,the fans are so passionate and it's built so beautifully and everyone's decked out in sweet gear.  it gets kinda claustrophobic in there, but whatever, it's just old school and that's how things used to be.  but one big complaint is the complete lack of diversity in the crowd.  it's like go here if you like drunk white men.  not my favorite crowd but i still love fenway. ,fenway is good inside and out.  right outside of the stadium has such  exciting and intense energy.  it's so unlike anywhere else.  and going even farther out... there is nothing better than standing on mass ave and seeing the sky lit up on a summer night.,you won't get a feeling like fenway anywhere else.  you just won't."
love that dirrrty wataaa...
"4.5,It wouldn't be right to give Fenway fewer stars.  But a visit last night was so depressing that I can't honestly list it as my 2nd favorite ballpark anymore.  The Red Sox are a really good team.  People should watch.,And maybe 3% of the fans seem genuinely engaged by the on-field action.  Unless it's doing the ridiculous ""Youk"" squawk, pumping along to ""Sweet Caroline,"" doing the wave, or maniacally chanting ""Beat LA"" during a key at-bat in the 7th (hint: Boston is playing Oakland and Marco Scutaro probably couldn't give a tinker's damn who wins the NBA finals).  Never in my life have I attended a game where more fans stood up during innings, during at-bats, during pitches.  To stretch, to wave at people in other sections, and most nauseatingly, to take pictures with the goddamn mascot.  Grown men taking pictures with a mascot, blocking an entire section's view during a one-run ballgame late.  Seriously?,I grew up in New York.  I have been to games in Philadelphia.  My expectations of fan comportment are set very low to begin with.  But Red Sox fans are the worst behaved of any group I have observed.  And it has a very corrosive effect on one's enjoyment of the game.,The only saving grace was that an old guy in a worn Sox cap personally apologized to me on behalf of his flock.  And the Park really, really looks good at about 8:15 PM in early June when you're sitting low in the grandstand."
"Ya, ya, ya. It's rundown, it's cramped, the seats are uncomfortable, everything is expensive.,Despite all of that, Fenway is the best place to see a ballgame in the country. Think of it as the historic dive bar of baseball parks. ,The fans here are enthusiastic and in every game. You can often just start talking to people in the seats near you, and you should expect that they will start talking to you. ,I have never felt so wrapped up in anything as I felt at a playoff game there. They just put other teams to shame in that place energy wise. You just have to go.,To get tickets, which is hard, a good way to go is to show up day of game about 2 hours early and get in line. They hold a few hundred or thousand tickets and sell them at face value, but you have to go right in. This is to cut down on scalping. Avoid Ace Tickets like the plague."
"If you like old stuff and history, come to Fenway."
"As many of you know, I love baseball.  I wait all year for pitchers and catchers to report to spring training, and follow along through October.   I crave the sound of the bat cracking, the sight of a home run being launched over then Green Monster, and the rousing rendition of ""Sweet Caroline.""   The strength of my love has ebbed and flowed over the years, but I have remained true to my Red Sox.  ,Being from Nevada, some may consider that I am just a fair-weather fan.  I can assure everyone that this is not the case, because up until this year, I have been to ONLY Red Sox games.  My first game was at Fenway, sitting in the old seats with my family, including my grandfather.,My grandfather was a true fan.  Born and raised in Massachusetts, he would sit in his chair that was probably older than I was, and watch until the wee hours of the morning.  Although 50 years separated us, the Red Sox became a common bond that allowed us to subtley communicate how we really felt about each other.,My last visit to Fenway was with my grandfather.  I was lucky enough to score some pretty sweet seats, down the right field line in the Loge Box.  Not only did the Sox win that night, but as everyone knows, they won twice over the span of 3 years after an 86 year drought.   My grandfather waited for 83 of those 86 years for the Red Sox to win.,Here is what makes Fenway Park so magical- no matter where you sit, you are a part of the game.  It's such an intimate atmosphere that you can feel the electric current run through the stands, long before ""Dirty Water"" comes through the speakers.  It's the type of place where you can take your grandfather and have the time of both your lives.  ,If you have been to Fenway, go again.  And take someone special with you- sharing that experience is something else about that park that can't be missed."
"Does life get any better? Doubtful. A fenway frank in one hand, a beer in the other and the soul of Boston -- the Red Sox -- in front of me makes for a magnificent night. ,Here's the deal -- if you're visiting, get some good seats ahead of time, show up to the park a couple of hours early and just walk around the outside area. Check out the yawkey way concourse prior to the game and hit up your favorite (America's Best) sports bar or night club afterward. If you're from here -- wait until 7:10 to get your tickets. There's plenty of scalpers and the prices drop at or below face for good seats. Just be prepared to drive a bargain or walk away.,Also, somebody proposes every game. Can we cut the crap and man up? Its not original anymore. sheesh."
"Fenway Park is a timeless classic, but I really like how the current management has revamped the park in recent years.  The last time I went to Fenway Park back when it was still owned by the Harrington Family, the seats were cramped and it just wasn't a very enjoyable experience.  But when I went to a recent home game here, my seats were great and very comfortable, not cramped at all.  Crowd watching was fun as well.  Great experience.  I used to think that Fenway Park South (Camden Yards in Baltimore) was better than the actual Fenway Park, but Fenway Park is great now."
"I LOVE this ballpark! I've been to a lot of them too. The history, the age, the green monster, everything! We came here on August the 3rd, drove up from PA, we pick a Boston team to come see each year. First time at Fenway,  they made the trade for Peavy and he was pitching!  4 rows back on the first base side! Made it that much better! ,The fans are amazing, they know their stuff, they weren't rude to anyone around us. They asked where we were from and if this was our first game. Took pictures of the two of us together.  ,Before and after the game wondering around outside the ballpark is great too. You get to see an amazing atmosphere, great vendors,  go into the team stores, take great pics, and Yawkey Way is just the street you NEED to walk down. ,Inside the ballpark there is a wall with the years and the designs of the red sox, everyone stands in line to get their picture taken by them. After coming to Fenway, nothing and I mean NOTHING can top this ballpark for me!"
"The Holyland! The House that Ruth left, Ted Williams, Yastrzemsk, Pedro, The Idiots, Kevin Millar, Big Papi & Wakefield oh what a fantastic park. Anthony Lapanta sports analyst from Minnesota told me it's a venue all ball fans should see but you might not want to visit it ever again and I am NOT one of those people. I'm already planning my trip there next year. The game started at 1:35 so we of course arrived at 10:30am. Just needed to walk around and take it all in. We didn't spend enough time walking around on the inside of the park. That is part of the reason I'm planning my trip next year. ,What I did see was Ted Williams Museum. Fantastic! And very narrow hallways under the seats. But that's just how they built them back then. Let's talk about prices! I'm pretty sure Target Field is worse. I was hearing horror stories about how much I was going to have to pay for food in the park and just outside. Go to the Bleacher bar for 5 dollar beers. Already pretty close to beer outside of Target Field. Then inside I'll admit I didn't have a beer inside. I was intoxicated on the history and beauty of the park. But the prices I did see were either lower or very close to the same as Target Field. ,It could be that you Bostonians are just getting jaded. Here we have this broken down old field. Nothing special about it after you've grown up seeing games there. So why don't they build us a new one? I can tell you if you don't like high prices, you do not want a new field. I ask you to remember how old this park of yours is. You know it opened the same week that Titanic sank. Think about the names that have played there. Not the great names of today. But men from the 20s & 30s. I may someday forget the outcome of that game I saw (Your Sox 6 my Twins 4) but I will never forget sitting there and thinking on just that. The men who played this game on that field. I caught myself doing that more than watching the game. Ty Cobb, Joe Jackson, Walter Johnson and your own Ted Williams.,I miss Fenway."
"Fenway has always been my favorite ballpark. EVER. I loved in MA for 13 years and still try to go back every year for 1 game at least. I love how old it is and of course Landsdowne and Yawkey are right there. Concessions are great, bathrooms hardly have a wait and I defintiely love cold beer on draft. It's accessible from the T which is a bonus as parking prices can be astronomical. Love you Fenway..."
San Francisco really knows how to take care of the homeless and mental ill. This is very evident with the amount of nasty people ready to scare you here.
"I was expecting a rundown Victorian Hall. San Francisco is a very old city. Lots of landscapes, homes and neighborhoods are pretty run down and need some major facelift. So, I expected the same for the City Hall.,When I drove around this Hall, I was very impressed. Even though it was in the late evening, I can see that they kept the streets and roads clean around this location. And up kept the Roman decor on the outside very well. I was very interested on how it looked on the inside.,I walked up those narrow steps and under Roman designed columns and into a room where you walk through a metal detector. From there, you walk into a hall way where it leads to other several other halls.,The main hall is in the center of the whole building. It's beautiful. I felt like I was in a Roman arena about to battle it out with gladiator... if the long stair case wasn't in the way hehee,There smaller halls on the left and right and also behind this center. They are smaller compared to the main hall, but their still long and large and impressive.,I hope to visit this hall again during the day time or maybe even the opportunity to squeeze in a photo shoot. That would be a dream =)"
"Normally Library's are the last bastion of refuge for the down and out of our cities. This  is the first time I've can remember being at the Central Library in my adult life. (Kid are sometimes taken hostage by the LAUSD and taken on so called ""Field Trips""),The Library was cool, and huge. There are floors and layers of art. If your reading this in early 2015 there is an exhibit of the Los Angeles music scene between 1976 and 1989. It is worth it if you happen to be at the library.,At night I felt like there was one way in to the library like a fortress and a cop at the door. Maybe it was because of the photo reception maybe, its that dangerous in the shelves at night."
"i came here without any tickets.,heard about the option to wait it out in line for tickets at face value that go on sale at 5:10, game at 7pm.  u go immediately into park to prevent scalping!,I waited 1.5 hours getting there at about 4pm, paid $52 per ticket, 2 for the bf and i, sat together in the grandstand, in the shade, right behind home plate!,bathrooms are not bad, the lines, not at all super long.  seats were not the most comfortable, slated wooden seats, but we had ample leg space!,not an empty seat in the whole place, it was only the texas rangers, but sheesh gotta admire the love red sox have! ,people were not rude, no disorderly conduct, just good old fashion fun!  i have been to dodgers and angels game, sheesh people.,i love the park, it was awesome to hear an organ play before the game.  awesome seats, great helpful staff, food not too bad!,had ice cream, yummy $4.50,italian sausage $6.75,hot dog for the bf $4.00,fries, sorry, forgot the price,my souvenir cup $6.75, lg enough for bf and i,italian sausage was not that bad, could of preferred it a little spicy, but kids can eat this, however, it is so large!,i loved this place, the history, the fanfare, the excitement.  people actually come here for the game, for the love of it and it made for a fun time!"
"Other than the Sox losing the game I attended & 1 beer costing more than a 6-pack, Fenway is awesome!  I liked the fact that the food vendors hold what they're selling over their head so everyone can see.  Then hearing the guys yellin ""Chowdah heeah!"" really completed my Fenway experience, go Sox!"
"Going back to Fenway after growing up with the park is sort of like meeting my dead grandfather if Wal-Mart exhumed his corpse and turned it into a cyborg greeter.,It's amazing how what was once the best park in the majors is now an absolute cesspool of forced promos and moronic ""fans."" Went to a game this past week and got to see some CEO throw out the ceremonial first pitch (at least I wasn't there for the NASCAR force feeding the other night, gah) then another highest bidder threw out the ceremonial...um, second pitch. Followed by those two words nobody wants to hear and the abysmal song that follows. ,Saw a decent pitchers duel between Beckett and Haren, ruined by the pink hat buzzing in my ear about putting her house on the market from the time she showed up in the middle of the 2nd to the time she left with her posse of suburban moms who totally think they're the Carrie of their group in the middle of the 7th, SICK FANDOM GIRLZ! ,Ads all over the place, dwarfing the little green monster scoreboard (which was always my favorite part of the park as a kid) because WB Mason just bought your first born. Camden Yards is a better ballpark, Wrigley Field is a better ballpark, New Busch Stadium is a better ballpark, hell even The Trop is a better ballpark now. Just like Steinbrenner ruined Yankee Stadium with the mid-70s overhaul Lucchino, Henry and Werner are pissing all over Fenway with each little shoehorned seat. Fuck Game On, bring back Ryan's.,$8 beers FTL"
"Got married here on a Monday morning in October.  There was no one there!  Our photos looked like we had the place to ourselves (because we practically did).  Definitely recommend the early work week wedding - we went the Friday before to get our license and the place was a zoo. ,We got married on the landing of the grand staircase around 11:30am.  Our photographer said the lighting was excellent.  The ceremony was literally 2 minutes - saying ""I do"" and then exchanging the rings.  But it was short and sweet and got the job done!,My husband and I had talked about eloping somewhere, and when we saw this place we knew it would be perfect...and it was.  Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a beautiful, affordable location to have a simple ceremony."
"I have a nook, and I heard that I can download a lot of ebooks free from the public library.  Hence, I stopped by this library today and got a library card.  It was a 5 minute process.  Complete an application located at the table in the corner and go to Check In/Out line with a photo i.d.,You can go to its website , and download ebooks, as well as audio books to your p.c   I haven't figured out how to download the books to the nook yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.,This library is a truly beautiful work of architecture.  It takes up vast amount of real estate and is three stories high.  It has a food court by the Flower entrance that consists of Panda Inn and a cafe that serves coffee, salads and drinks.  It's a peaceful place in the midst of the bustling downtown, LA."
A very beautiful library and has all the books I need!!!!
"Pros: Extensive book collection. ,           A floor for each genre pretty much.,           Beautiful architecture ,           Historical vibe to get lost in and explore.,           Mall-like experience, dunno why that's a pro. ,Cons: Difficult, expensive parking. Why bother? I order my books to the ,             nearest LAPL location instead.,            Foul smells in certain floors. I don't know what it is and I don't want to know.,            ,Here's the thing. I read to relax, even when doing research. The one time I came here, it was somewhat stressful because of traffic, parking, and just trying to get around. I'll only come here again only if I really really need to."
"The ticket prices are ridiculous, the seats are cramped, and the alcohol policies are puritanical but the experience as a whole is magical--the spirit of baseball at its finest.  I've visited a good deal of ballparks around North America and can easily rank Fenway Park at the top of my list (alongside Chicago's Wrigley Park, San Fran's AT&T Park, and Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards). ,My major criticism of the ballpark is the odd seating--especially out in right-field (which I would never recommend).  If you're lucky enough to score Green Monster tickets or expensive box seats then good for ya!  Otherwise, your best bet is finding a seat out in the outfield bleachers where the real carnival happens.,The food and beer Is better than one would expect and the historic scenery definitely has its charm but the real character of the ballpark comes from the fans who don't need corny promotions or forced stimulation to get them excited.  The game is sacred and many are willing to sacrifice their comfort as a necessary burden in revering their baseball idols."
"This park takes the cake of walking in and feeling like you have a place in history.  The Green Monster is the symbol of Fenway and stands out beautifully.  My first experience here was Standing Room only, but I have been to about 4 games here, one fortunate enough to be Red Sox/Yankees.  ,I had a lot of close friends in college who were die hard Sox fans, and I caught onto the fan base pretty easily.  Sox fans truly love their team, and the ticket prices reflect that.,Best food item to get: Clam Chowder, by far.  The Fenway Frank is not that impressive to me.,All in all, I don't think you can have a bad experience here if you are visiting and want to see a great baseball game.  Thankfully, the fans never got obnoxious, I experienced a lot of people who had been going to games for years and people were super friendly."
"Visiting Fenway has been a dream of mine for awhile.  When the boyfriend and I got there, it was hot, humid, and storming.  That did not stop the masses of Red Sox fans from having a great time.  Once we sat down to watch the game, we did realize how uncomfortable the seats were.  Especially when two 6 feet tall men sat by us.  That did make the game uncomfortable.  We still had a good time and enjoyed a Fenway Frank.,By the way, the Fenway Frank is a million times better than the Dodger Dog."
"It's taken me over 6 years of living in Boston to finally make it to a game at Fenway Park. Not only did I pop my Fenway Park cherry, it was also my first time at a professional sporting event. Yes, I know, this is ridiculous information considered I use to live blocks from Fenway. While I don't have anything to compare this experience with, it was a great time. All the staff were super friendly and helpful. ,I thought the bathrooms would be a disaster since I went to the 2nd game in a double header. Thankfully, they were alright all things considered."
"Watching a ballgame at Fenway is kind of like watching baseball the way it used to be. Well almost. On the night I was there- a luxury box- was my seat for the night, but some of the seats are still the original wood ones from long ago! ,This intimate ballpark, built in 1912, reminds me of all the great old ballparks out there that haven't been replaced by the super stadiums that put the fan, well out of reach of the action. ,Even though I was lucky enough to sit in one of the luxury boxes, I felt that I was ""in the game"", although my team didn't fare too well against the Red Sox, a team the Cubs hadn't played at Fenway since 1918. ,The luxury suites are located about midway up in the stadium and are really nice. There is a large indoor area with a private bathroom (with a TV so you miss none of the action) and full kitchen (counters piled with the catered food) and a living room with large, over sized leather furniture in case the weather is inclement. And then out the back door are 20 or so private seats to luxuriate in while you cheer on your favorite team. And my favorite feature? There are ceiling heaters outside above the seats so even if the Boston weather is not shining that day, a flip of a switch will have you warm and comfortable while you sip your cold beer and eat your hot dog! ,It's a fun night although I still don't know why they sing ""Sweet Caroline"" in the middle of the 7th inning. Or why the sundaes that they serve have ""jimmies"" on them rather than ""Sprinkles"". Or why the Red Sox only shake each other's hands at the end of the game rather than the other team's. Or why the green wall is called the ""Green Monster"" (Maybe because no one can hit over the thing?) ,But no matter. On a cool, clear night in Boston, baseball is the name of the game, and Fenway is just the place to watch it. Even if my team must have been playing some other sport given the huge loss that they suffered! ,Play ball!"
"I used to love Fenway. I'd throw around the same words that everyone else always does when talking about the place; ""Historic"", ""character"", ""experience"", and all the rest. ""How could you not love Fenway Park!?"", I would ask. Then I visited another stadium. My weekend in Baltimore was great and my visit to San Francisco was even better. Now, after seeing what a real stadium can be like, if you rig Fenway with explosives and hand me the big red button, I will gladly push it. ,Think of your least favorite restaurant. Now imagine that Abe Lincoln used to eat there all the time, that Adolf Hitler once stopped in for a bite, and that it was a favorite of Martin Luthur King. Does the food there taste any better? Is the experience more enjoyable? No. So what does it matter that Fenway is full of history? Who really gives a damn that the impossible dream season of '67 unfolded there? What does it matter that Ted Williams, the greatest hitter to ever live, called the place his home? The place is full of history to be sure, but that doesn't mean that it's not a dump. ,I go to a few games a year with two buddies and between the three of us we're talking about 800 pounds of Sox fan. In April and September it takes a few minutes of strategic bending and shifting in order for all three of us to fit into the seats. Luckily during the hot summer months I'm able to just slide right down into the middle of them because all the sweat acts as a great lube. Our seats don't point at the plate but at least we don't have a pole in front of us like so many other seats in Fenway have. ,To make matter worse, Sox fans pay more money than anyone else for the priveledge of watching a game. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the owners run the team like a business. I'm glad the gouge the fans and empty families' wallts. With the demand as high as it is, it makes sense to take us for all we're worth. Having an all-star caliber team with a $180 million payroll is fun to watch, but that doesn't mean that I enjoy forking over $7.50 for a beer after giving them a day's pay just to get into the place.,With all that said, I do love the atmosphere of game day. I love the crowds, the bars, the hot dogs, and the buzz that a game generates. I love the fact that baseball stadiums are all unique. Fenway has some characteristics that set it apart from every other stadium in the world. But you know what else could have crowds, bars, hot dogs, and character? A shiny new stadium. One where the seats face the game. One that's designed to fit the fat asses that we've all become. One that doesn't look like a dungeon. ,I will continue to go to Fenway because nothing beats a hot dog and a beer in front of the greenest grass on the planet with a couple of friends on a 75 degree summer night. But until a new stadium is built, the best seat in the house is in my living room."
"Drunk people being thrown out. Cops taking pictures for you and with you. Yankees suck. Clam chowder. Sweet Caroline. Yankees suck. And for that matter, Yawkey Way before the game, and the mass exodus to the T and beyond afterwards. Yankees suck.,What a great experience. Others who've written that you need to see a game at Fenway in your lifetime are spot on right. A life-long Chicagoan whose ballparks are heralded as great landmarks and deeply beloved, Fenway is right up there with Comiskey and Wrigley. I can't wait to return to see another game!"
"OK, in general a review of Fenway is pretty much a no brainer,normally I wouldn't waste my time,BUT,I attempted to give it 6 stars today because for the first time in 10 years....,BEER GUY,Yes, Heineken, Bud Lt, Miller Lt, Coors Lt - all delivered to your seat for $7-8.  Beer is not cheap at Fenway anywhere - but the fact that for the first time in my 10 years, some dude brought it to me.  PRICELESS,the stars have all aligned - and I can die happy,oh, we lost tonight - but I am still on a 6 star high."
"I'm a born and bred Yankees fan, but I've got to hand it to the Sox, Fenway park was a great place to see a game.,Walked off the T and there were about two dozen people selling extras.  My friend and I got great seats for $30.,And to only think I only heard one Yankees Suck cheer.  Overall, a nice park that I'm going to have to make more trips too."
"Plenty of charisma and character to the place. I checked in here just to have a look, didnt get seats for the Redsox v Kansas City Royals game that night, stood on the bleachers, had no interest in the game, decided to wander around the stadium and have a look at the place with my friend before venturing out into Boston city in my limited time there,For the Record: The Redsox won the game"
"Went to the game 9/19/13 and had a great time - Boston is absolutely spoiled with such an awesome venue, such a great team, and the ability to provide the fans with such a rich history of the game.  Fantastic time and will be sure to get tickets for another game in the near future, just as an excuse to come back!"
"Tonight while walking back to the hotel from dinner near Civic Center we exclaimed ""oh my"" to a homeless woman pooping as discretely as possible in a corner. She apologized. I think this great city needs to apologize to its homeless for not providing a place to relieve themselves and feel somewhat human. Shame on you San Francisco!"
"OMG!!!  The best library I have been to!!!  I LOVE this place.  The place is huge with several floors of books on anything and everything to could ever possibly want to know or read about.  Even if they don't have the book you want or are looking for, they can get for you in a day or two.  ,There are so many quiet areas to could go to study or read.  Whether you just want a comfy chair or need a table with an outlet, you'll have no problem find what you need.  The staff is wonderful and always helpful.  But then again, I'm probably a little biased since I work in the Adult Literacy Center working as a LEP Instructor and helping people with limited english proficiency."
The best place in MLB to watch a game. Go Sawks!
Very nice park but mean photographers.
"A very cool stadium, too bad it's full of Red Sox fans.  I was there cheering for the Sox and by the end of the game, I felt dirty for being one of them...  Otherwise, a very cool stadium, tiny but cool."
"Since I am a born and raised SF Giants fan I am also just reviewing my experience at Fenway. It was pretty damn good. Let's start by saying that all Boston babies first words must be Go Red Sox. Every man, woman and child living in the greater Boston area owns the Boston uniform (Red Sox hat, Red Sox Jersey, Red Sox whatever). It's insane. They all love their Red Sox. The fans are seriously die hard, borderline insane. ,The stadium itself is a great size (not too big and not too small) and is apparently often sold out. We were lucky enough to get tickets the same day and watched the most amazing game against the Twins. The Red Sox were down until the 7th inning until someone hit a 3 run homer and tied the game up and then later they got another run and won the game. The fans were freaking crazy, crazy insane during the entire game. Cheering, screaming, singing. They even played that damn song by the Dropkick Murphys ""I'm Shipping Up to Boston."" The entire stadium started singing all at once. ,I have to admit that the funniest part of the evening is when I ran into another SF Giants fan at the game who was actually wearing his Giants hat. Ran over and took a picture with him. That was pretty brave in Red Sox country."
theres a security check point line like the airport..but it goes quick - if u got nothing to hide!
So pretty! Free entrance plus you'll get to see a ton of people getting married at the same time
"Fenway park is still the best place in existence to watch a baseball game.,Sure, the seats are cramped and unergonomical, the beer costs $6.50, a small bottle of soda $4.25, but those are small prices to pay.,Firstly, no matter where you sit in the park you are relatively close to the action.  No need to bring the binoculars to this park.,Secondly, it's all about tradition.  Fenway park is one of the oldest parks in the country still in use, and it just oozes of Baseball tradition.  It feels like stepping into a time warp.  Everything from the old fashioned score-board, to the singing in the 7th inning stretch enhances the experience.,Thirdly, the Red Sox.   Easily the most lovable baseball team in existence,I can't give this place anything but 5 stars."
"I've lived in the Boston area all my life, so The Boston Red Sox, and Fenway Park, are more than a team and a park to me. Fenway is perfect in every way, and I am not worthy to 'review' it. If you are from the Boston area and you grew up with the Red Sox, you have already been to Fenway, and there is nothing more I can tell you about it. If you are thinking of visiting for the first time, I have some useful advice for you.,You are going to pay a lot to park. Just do it. Think maybe you're not close enough to the ball park yet? You are. Park already. The walk is part of the pilgrimage. Enjoy the sights, the sounds, the smells.. Wondering which way to your gate, which one to enter the park through? It doesn't matter. You can get to your seat from any of the five gates. Make sure you're ready t enter the park first. Have you seen the whole outside yet? You should. Walk around it at least once. You have time, don't worry. And don't try and figure out which gate is where. Gate B is not between gates A and C, gate C is not between gates B and D. That's not the way we do things here. Keep walking, enjoy the sights, the sounds... You'll eventually come to your gate, you might even decide to walk a little further, see what's up ahead.. Go ahead, like I said, you can get to your seat through any of the five gates. While your enjoying the walk, you might want to get something to eat before you go in. It's very, very expensive inside the park. I suggest one of the many sausage vendors working the carts just outside the gates. There must be twenty of them, spread around the park.  Avoid the sausage guy just outside Gate B,  he is disgusting. But if you get hungry inside, get the Fenway Frank. I am a hot dog fanatic, I travel all around world (mostly around Boston) looking for great hot dogs, and while Fenway Franks are not ""The Best"" hot dog, the overall hot dog experience just may be the best you will ever have. I don't know that I've ever eaten anything that tastes as good as that steamed dog in the soggy bun, passed down the row, hand to hand, garnished with the little packets tucked in with the dog... something magical about that particular dog being eaten at this holy place... If you're from New York, and you choose to wear your Yankees cap/shirt inside the park....  good for you! We will tease you and harass you in the good natured way that sport rivals do, but you are perfectly safe, it's all in good fun. So if you are a Yankee fan, welcome to  Boston, and with all due respect..... you suck."
"What else can I say that already hasn't been said.  ,Fenway is a great place to watch a game.  The atmosphere is just amazing.  The Red Sox fans come out every game and support their team no matter what.  Being a O's fan I'm not used to crowded stadiums but it was so worth it and this place is just electric.  The fans are paying attention to every pitch and react to every pitch.  Loved walking up and down Yawkey Way and going into the store, and getting some great food and drink before the game.  ,If your a baseball fan you must come to Fenway and experience it for yourself, it's something to behold."
It's Fenway Park. I don't think I really need to say anything other than that. It's a baseball Mecca. Love doesn't describe it.
"Where do I even begin? Yes it's old, seats are tight and the view of the field may be at least partially obstructed, but this is hallowed ground. It is not only a ballpark but a museum. Simply attending a ballgame here does not do it justice. If you're visiting Boston (or even if you're a local), take the green line T to Kenmore Square. When you exit the station you'll see the iconic Citgo sign. On TV the sign looks like part of the ballpark but it's actually several blocks away. Don't walk towards it or you'll be going the wrong way and will end up at the Charles. If you're a first timer, take the tour. You'll get to sit in the 1934 wooden seats, go up into the club seats behind home plate and on top of the Green Monster. But there is plenty more to see that isn't on the tour. So arrive at least an hour before gametime, walk around the outside, then go inside and walk the concourses, where you will see numerous displays honoring Red Sox greats. And go to the red seat where Ted Williams hit the longest home run in Fenway history in 1950. Seriously there is LOTS to see here before the game so allow plenty of time for it. During the game, just take it all in. Have a Fenway Frank and a beer (lots of New England microbrews featured-I went with Long Trail). And be sure to sing along to Sweet Caroline during the middle of the 8th inning. And hopefully you'll hear Dirty Water and Tessie after a Sox win. And no matter what, if this place doesn't give you goose bumps you're not a baseball fan."
UMMMM...only my favorite place in the world!!!
"All of the Red Sox fans we're super nice and great with giving advice about places to see while in Boston. Some of the nicest baseball fans I've encountered while at a visiting stadium (they weren't playing my team that night, so I'm sure that's why they were nice). Really a class act crowd! The women's bathrooms we're pretty old school, but, I'm used to Wrigley so they weren't any better then those ones :),Random Christine/Fenway Factoids: ,They sell Clam Chowdah at the games. Umm, awesome! ,If the 7th inning stretch isn't your thing, they've the 8th inning to cheer you up here! Sweet Caroline will  be heard and sung by all, pretty amazing! Found the game I was at, ,Fenway Park has THE BIGGEST bleacher section I've ever seen. ,Yawkey Way is a fantastic place to party before/after the games. EVERY stadium should have something like this, but it makes Boston unique. ,A Fenway Frank is a hotdog on a piece of white bread, but you should still get it anyways. ,The Green Moster will take your breath away. If it doesn't, LEAVE! ,Fenway (as well as Boston) is expensive, but so worth it!,Here was the game I was at, 12 runs, 1 inning, absoutley AMAZING! ,Found a video of pics of the game I was at... "
"Fenway is the best.  Red sox games are great to watch there and even concerts when they roll through.  The Police show was awesome.,I am very happy with the improvements they have made over the years.  I was upset about them closing off yawkey for ticket holders and pushing out the vendors that had been there for generations.  Now I feel that this expansion into the street was a great idea and helps to alleviate some of the congestion.,The way they opened everything up under the bleachers is great, it feels like there so much more space.,I love going into the games early and having a few brews at one of the bars like the cask n flagon, and then grabbin a sausage with onions & peppers from one of the street vendors before heading into the park.,The seats can be uncomfortable and the stadium is crowded but thats the fenway I love.  To think about the greats that played there and the hisory that was made overshadows any negatives about the ballpark.,If you want a nice cushy seat while you watch the game stay at home in your lazy boy.,If you want to experience the greatest ballpark in America filled with Red Sox Nation faithful make sure Fenway Park and a Red Sox game is at the top of your list."
"Go! Now!,See my Monster Pix. - Then GO!"
"I'm not even sure why I have to write this review... I really don't, but the season just ended and Bobby V. just got fired today... so for the first time in a while I felt good about the Sox.,Fenway is as real as it gets to me when it comes to baseball.  There is so much history here for me personally as well as for the team in general.  I am so grateful that the current ownership is serious about winning championships and building up the neighborhood around the park.  ,When I head to New York and go to Yankee Stadium is when I respect just how much the new ownership group (it's been long enough... but the Yawkees had the team for so long that they still feel new).  Around Yankee Stadium, there isn't jack shit to do before a game... there are a few hole in the walls, but nothing to really hang your hat on.,Around Fenway you have Lansdown St. with a bunch of places to go before and after a game.  They block off the other side of the stadium on the street to have a fair like atmosphere.  There is a bar to duck into if there is a rain delay and you can get back into the park through there.  ,It turns a Friday night game into a real great time.  Even when the team is losing, at least you can walk out the door and hit up Cask N' Flagon, Lansdown Pub, Jillians, Game On and more.  If I walk out of Yankee Stadium, I'm just happy if I can just get to the train without getting trampled or in a fight.  ,Even after her face lift, Fenway will never be the most comfortable park... but the nostalgia you get when you walk into there can't be duplicated.  I walked into the new Yankee Stadium and it lacks that real baseball feel... can't describe it, but it felt like a fake baseball game."
"Boston fan or not, Fenway Park should be on everyones bucket list!"
America's most beloved ballpark. Only thing they are lacking is automated social media sharing.
"I just had my wedding here and the building is beautiful. ,The one star is for the Events Department in City Hall. I rented out the whole fourth floor for my big day which the events department is in-charge of and they dropped the ball big time. I was convinced that no other wedding parties would be allowed but as my wedding began so did a whole other party across the way which affected my wedding photos. My photographer had to shoot at odd angles so I didn't have the other party in my photos. Instead of the events department taking care of the situation, they did nothing about it. I had to have one of my guest go and make the events department do their job which was too late.  ,Another issue I had with the events department is that I rented chairs as well which were not setup prior to my wedding. Events Department were suppose to setup chairs and block off with a sign stating it was reserved for my wedding. I had to have one of my guest take care of this as well. ,Events Department at SF City Hall has not responded to my emails or phone calls. I think the whole situation was unorganized and unacceptable. ,If you're a bride booking the fourth floor at SF City Hall I would advise against it."
most extravagant library i've ever been to. the ambience is gorgeous. it's three stories and a perfect place to study.
"Best baseball stadium ever.  Even if the seats are built for people who are 5 feet tall.,Full disclosure.  I AM a Red Sox fan."
"Living in the Bay Area and being a Boston sports fan, I finally got to make my pilgrimage to Fenway. We went on the tour and it was fantastic. Learned so many things about the park, the oldest baseball park in the country (1912), that I never knew or fully understood. The tour guides were funny and friendly and allowed for many great photo stops. Thanks Fenway and thanks Boston."
"went to a Red Sox game back in 1992 when Roger Clemens(my favorite pitcher of all time) pitched. definitely a treat. the outside environment was fun. Fenway is old, and thus I could barely fit in my seat. if you're big and tall, getting comfortable can be a challenge. I'm due to go to another game again when i visit the east coast again. ,go A's."
"Tips for those who wish for a simple wedding ceremony. ,;,We got married on a Thursday afternoon here. Booked marriage license appointment ($99+ $5 convenience fee) and ceremony ($75 + $5 convenience fee) three months ahead online. Filled out marriage license form the day before. ,On the day of,  we checked in at the County Clerk's for the marriage license, hung out at the cafe for a bit (just FYI, the City Hall restroom is not the best place to get dolled up), and met up with friends for the ceremony an hour later. Since it was midweek, City Hall was nearly empty. We got to marry at a location of our choosing. In our case, we liked the lighting on the fourth floor and it was away from spectators.  We told our officiant that we didn't want to exchange rings so it cut our ceremony down to less than five minutes. Although the website said you shouldn't have more than 6 people present for the ceremony,  the couple before us had about a dozen guests. I suppose the rules are lax for non-busy weekdays.  ,Officiant will turn in the paperwork for you if you have the ceremony here. You wait ten days and send in request for marriage certificate ($14 a copy. ,). Don't bother using VitalChek for online ordering! It seems more complex than mailing the request yourself and a notary is still required for the authorization form (to be faxed in to SF County Assessor-Recorder). I've been waiting for five days and counting for VitalChek to confirm fax receipt. I had to call the Recorder directly to confirm. VitalChek website says ordering takes 20-30 days. I will go with 30 days at the rate this is going.  ,As for how beautiful the City Hall is for photos, what everyone else said. You won't regret it."
"The crowds.,The game.,The cheers.,The smell of popcorn, hot dogs, sausage.,""Sweet Caroline."",7th inning stretch.,Little kids dancing on the big screen.,A cold beer at a hot game.,Chanting Yankees Suck when we aren't playing the Yankees.,Dads and daughters.,Hats of every color (but only red, blue & green count).,Waiting til next year.,Hard seats, tight quarters, obstructed views.,Knowing that you're sitting where generations before you sat just to watch America's pasttime, no matter the cost.,Fenway: perfect."
"Hands down, absolutley the best ball park in the country, it has a flair all of it's own, even Yankee's fans friends of mine give it props.  If you are any where close to being a true baseball fan then you gotta catch a game here before you leave this earth, yes it's that deep.,GO SOX!"
"definitely one of the best parks in the country.  small, intimate, lots of history.  the tour was informative and the right length of time.  i would say its right up there with pac bell park in sf."
"If I really have to explain why I gave 5 stars,  your not from Boston or Wickad Retahded"
Of course Fenway gets 5 starts...  Only problem is the seats suck.  The ass width has to be the smallest in any MLB park and the leg room is horrible.  It's still Fenway...  GO SOX!
Boston.. You're my home. And now $5 beers during game days. Yes please.
"I love the Red Sox and ""Friendly Fenway."",The beer is overpriced, watery and for some reason there's an entire deck in Right Field for Cardinals fans. (""Budweiser Deck?""),Still, for the the last of the great old parks, you can't go wrong."
"- Buying a ticket with face value of $35 from Craigslist ---- $60,- Getting tank with your friends before entering the Fenway at a neighbor bar to keep the in-stadium purchase minimum ---- $30,- A plastic cup of Guinness ---- $8.50,- Fenway Frank ---- $4,- Poland Spring(20oz) ---- $2,- Still loving this team and its shrine even after constantly getting pissed at them for repeatedly leaving men on base while spending loads and loads of money for ""boned-in-the-ass"" overpriced food and drink --- priceless.,For everything else, there's mastercard.....,P.S. If you haven't lived here long enough or are not a Red Sox fan, you'd give this place 1 star like Go R. And I am not offended."
"As much as I hate the Red Sox, Fenway Park is actually a great place to catch a game.  The neighborhood around the stadium is practically an extension of the park.  It's almost surreal to sit in the bleachers and look over at the Green Monster.  I'll even give Fenway bonus points because I was at the game when Manny disappeared into the Monster."
"Oooh, it's the House of the Holy!,On a rainy day like Tuesday against the Oakland A's, I thought for sure that we could win this one. Unfortunately, one too many balls were dropped, and not enough offense gives Boston the L.,But, a foolish faithful like myself can't be let down by Fenway the Great! Even when, it just so happens that I always sit next to the biggest person alive, or behind the tallest FoN...,The ushers wiped our seats down and I enjoyed watching my boys play on the beautiful open green grass. ,Life couldn't be better."
"We actually braved the blizzard to take a tour of this one.,Worth visiting once for sure.,The sound and light show is kind of lame. ,Try to catch a game if possible when you are there."
Great Park
"My wife and I went to Fenway Park in August 2004. Red Sox beat the Tigers 5-1. I was lucky enough to snatch 2 tickets prior to our visit. They were in the bleachers but it didn't matter. This cathedral to baseball was just as good as everyone told me it would be and as good as everyone on yelp says it is. We loved it, start to finish and all points in between. Even if you're not a fan of baseball, go to one game and you'll understand why it's a sight to behold. If those walls could talk!!!!"
"The Salesforce Holiday Party finally allowed me to get inside and see City Hall for myself.,I have walked and driven by SF's City Hall multiple times, and it has been on my to-do list to check out the inside for months now. And let me tell you I was NOT disappointed. It is GORGEOUS!! Granted it was very decorated and embellished for the party but even so, the architecture was breathtaking and the dome was really cool! There is also a really ornate looking grand staircase that leads up to the second floor where the mayor's office is, and it's really fun to walk up the stairs because you feel like royalty =),Definitely a cool place to visit, and there are statues and cool displays in the side rooms as well that teach you about SF!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to draw your attention to the best review on here: ,I went to Fenway for the first time in 2006. I got my ticket for $5 through my old college and my friend's then boyfriend worked for them, so we got one of those ""welcome"" messages on the big lit board. Our seats were pretty much on the field, so that was awesome. Like a total ditz I had a jones for someone that I thought was a bat boy..er whatever. He was totally a player.. forgot his name though.. lol I wasn't that impressed with the hot dogs or the billion dollar beer or the sore fans that left before the game was over.. but I did love the stadium. Don't tell anyone in Jersey that I bought a Red Sox hat ::gulp::"
"There's no Bostonian that should give Fenway anything less than 5 stars. In fact, there are no true Baseball fans that should. ,Sure, it's far from advanced. It's not sleek and sexy. It's dirty as hell and at times, uncomfortable.,But it's Fenway. It's a park that is as legendary as they come. It's a park that doesn't attempt to artifically sweeten the game of Baseball - it IS baseball. ,It's almost as if the years of sweat, tears, and competition have seeped into the very grounds of Fenway Park. It has a life all it's own because of this. And having been to other MLB stadiums in my time - that energy, that reverence - will never be matched.,This is a Park that I truly love, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that. ,Go Boston, Go Sox, Go Fenway."
"If you can help it, DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! We had the most challenging and stressful time with customer service in dealing with the San Francisco Court House. They lost our appointment even though we paid, gave us the wrong information on multiple occasions and then proceeded to blame us. Most of all, the majority of the people working in the office were unfriendly. What a shame since we were there to do something very important and positive for our lives (get married). I'm not sure if they are under staffed but I wish they had some training in etiquette in how to treat customers. We were shocked because we dealt with at least 4 different women, and only one of them was pleasant to deal with. The many forms you will fill out to get married, and the overall process in general, can be complicated. That is why we made sure to ask questions and try to educate ourselves. Yet, this office still treated us poorly, rushed us out and then referred us to the website instead of answer simple questions. I hope they get more organized because the location is gorgeous and the city of San Francisco has so much to offer. So with that being said....PLEASE GET CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING! Be kind and helpful to your customers. It's not hard. :)"
"Fenway Park is the bomb! I still remember my first trip to the ballpark with my dad when I was 7. The only downside to the experience was that I wanted a foam finger and my dad wouldn't get me one. ,This place is so awesome there are just no words to describe it. It is all about the feeling that you get when you are in there...I am just in complete awe of this place. I went here the other night for a concert for the first time...UNFREAKINBELIEVABLE,I sat on the field and couldn't believe where I was...I love you Fenway!!,by the way...went a few weeks ago to a game...and sis bought me my foam finger..that was awesome"
"Oh Fenway... how I love you. If only it were as easy for me to get here (and get tickets) as it is in DC for the Nats... but since I'm a New England girl at heart, I know I'll always manage to find a way back here. ,But really? What's not to love? Ok, yes the stadium is older and on the smaller side... but I wouldn't change a thing. It all adds to the feel. Old wooden seats, packed to capacity, a Fenway Frank and cold beer. ,In my last outing, one of the highlights was when the crowd actually managed to get the wave started and make complete rounds of the ball park thee times... granted this was probably because most of us had given up on the game at that point... oh well, there's always next time!"
"sitting behind home plate just four rows from the field was...was...was...i can't even describe it. you go there to enjoy a game of baseball, but the park itself is what makes your experience special. ,the history, the green monster, the boston red sox. it's just beautifully overwhelming. ,i need not say more.,just go and check it out for yourself."
"Lots of obstructed views but lots of charm.,The place has changed a ton since I was a kid but generally for the better. More food options and of higher quality. More seats and lots of tvs everywhere. I suppose that's what all the ballparks have.,Now if only we could get them to stop playing that terrible Niel Diamond song every game...,PASS"
"I came back to visit Fenway after 26 years.  Would it be just as I had remembered?,As I walked toward the admission gate, I passed several bratwurst vendors.  The scent of succulent meat filled sheep intestine was heavenly.  However, I was determined not to spoil my appetite, which was being reserved for the infamous Fenway Frank.,After garnishing my dog with mustard, onion and dill pickle condiment, I prepared to relish the savory goodness.  Instead, a wave of panic washed over me.  Where was the flavor?  Did my childhood memories bamboozle me?,And then I remembered the sweet smelling brats just outside the gate.  What Have I Done?!?  I couldn't leave, and the grilling carts were positioned too far away to hear my cries.,I managed to catch the attention of a young teen sporting a KC Royals hat.  We agreed that I would give him $20, after which he would place my order and return with the sausage.  In return, I would give him $2 for his trouble.,At first, I thought the young lad was just overly zealous when he sprinted toward the vendor.  My bliss hastily morphed into heartbreak as I observed him continue down the street, out of sight.  The half eaten Fenway Frank in my hand became as heavy as my heart.,Swoop Says: Make sure to also employ a bigger faster boy, to ensure your delivery.,Fenway is a mature stadium, rich in tradition... and that makes it a great ballpark in my book.  Go Sox!,~Swoop"
"Let me start by saying I'm a Yankee fan. I was born into it and have been that way since I was a kid watching Reggie and Thurman and Guidry, I had no choice. ,Despite my intense hatred for most things Red Sox, after checking out Fenway Park for the first time in years, I have to admit this is the most glorious setting in baseball and I'm jealous NYC doesn't have anything to compare.  ,We visited Fenway last weekend -- three and a half men -- for a game between the Sox and A's. My 6-year-old nephew wore his Yankees cap, and the only trouble came when he was spotted in the bleachers by Wally, the Boston mascot who wanted to take it away and eat it. ,Along with the playful Wally, who posed for pics with and without the Yanks cap, I have to admit that my Boston counterparts were a pretty classy bunch. In nearly every encounter we had during a long day, Sox fans were civil and friendly, even to us dirty New Yorkers. ,And as for Fenway, which turns 100 next season, there really is nothing else like it aside from Wrigley Field. This is the way baseball was and should be. Old wooden benches. Obstructed views. Hand-operated scoreboards. The Green Monster...,Watching a game here is like taking a step back in time. You can almost feel the ghosts of Teddy Ballgame, Yaz and Pedro lurking in the long afternoon shadows. ,A few other quick notes about the ballpark: ,* La Verdad seems to be the call for pre-game Mexican...,* Sweet Italian sausages on Yawkey Way are $7 and well worth it...,* Fans are allowed to go on top of the Green Monster after the game...,* The bleachers are where the liveliest fans sit...standing room only is fun...,* For a memorable photo, check out the Bank St Pavilion near the top, it's as high as you can get...,And lastly, if you're wearing a Yankees cap at Fenway and you spot Wally rolling your way, proceed with caution."
"This is me being as objective as possible.,I live in Miami but I was born in Philly and I am a Phillies Fan.,That said, Fenway is the most magical sports arena in America, I have been to many other cities but there something special about a place that does not have a zillion dollars of electronics and looks the when you visit as it did on TV when you were in junior high school.,I don't think there is a bad seat in the place and the fans are just "" enthusiastic and loud "" but respectful. "" ,The vendors also had to the mystique with the chanting and tossing the food and candies - it's like American Baseball on TV in the 70's in a good way.,Even if you don't like Baseball you will like Fenway"
"This an amazing stadium - so much culture, do much history! I'm not really a baseball fan, but my friend is and got tickets to a game. It was an experience of a lifetime. If you're going to Boston, you must find a way to see Fenway Park."
"Just go. Go, bring a loved one, and take the tour. It will make you swell with pride if you're from Boston and, heck, even if you aren't. The history, baseball culture, and stature of the sport in Boston is major. The tour guides are incredibly knowledgeable and will make you feel a part of every single thing that has ever happened at Fenway. Perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon. Just awesome!"
"Go the Distance.......,And to quote Moonlight Graham - ""You know we just don't recognize the most significant moments of our lives while they're happening. Back then I thought, well, there'll be other days. I didn't realize that that was the only day"",So don't pass up Fenway Park. It's where one of my baseball dreams came true.  But Wrigley will get you to heaven faster!"
"Best ballpark in MLB, and I've been around the bases, if you know what I mean. Get a fenway frank, and bitch about overpriced beers. Honestly thought, $7.50 for a 12 ounce can is the worst beer deal i've experienced in MLB so far. But shit, it's Fenway. ,This is how you maintain a classic ballpark. Go to Wrigley if you want to see a shittily maintained ballpark. Wrigley Sucks!!!,In case your interestested, my rankings are:,1. Fenway,2. AT&T/San Fran,3. US Cellular/White sox,4. Tropicana Field/Tampa (I'm Biased so don't listen),5. Miller Park/ Brewers,Bottom 5:,1. Metrodome/Minnesota,2. Shea stadium,3. Wrigley,4. Oakland Coliseum,5. whatever the hell the marlins park is currently called (worst experience in pro sports IMO)"
"Ummmm, it's Fenway. It deserves 5-stars simply because it's a historic ballpark. I used to be one of those people that wanted to see a more modern baseball field with better services and facilities, but then I smartened up. I hope this park lasts another 100 years (but unfortunately, it probably won't)."
"How fun is it to go to Fenway Park to go see a Red Socks game?!   This place is beautiful.  I heard that the owners spent $250M+ restoring this ball park to its original beauty.  Sooo worth the money!   Although the Red Socks lost the night that I went, it was worth the experience.,Most people take the green line T to Fenway park.  Caution - there are a LOT of people, most of them drunk!  It's kinda fun at first, but kinda annoying with people cannot control their liquor.,I grazed on the food inside the park!  I started with two hot dogs ($5.00 each) which were plain hot dogs and plain buns.  They offered basics - ketchup, mustard, relish, and fresh onions.    Meh.   The beers on draft were $8.00 each.  Kinda small cups, and you can drink them in a couple of sips. ,I had the kettle corn (in a bag) - $6.50.   Pretty cool, as the kettle corn is freshly made right there while you wait in line for about 20 minutes.  Absolutely delish and fun to eat in the stands.,Salted peanuts in the stand - $5.00 a bag.  Ripoff for peanuts that were extra salty.  Guess that goes with the territory.  It was worth the $5 to have the guy toss the bag of peanuts 1/2 way thru the aisle to me.  Right on!,Legal Seafood cup of clam chowder $8.00.  OUCH!   The chowder was some good tasting grub but kinda expensive at $8.00.  It was a small little cup - about 1 cup worth of soup.   Warmed the soul on a cold night, tho!,Chicken tender strips with fries.   Basic ball game food, meh!,I ate a lot, but had a lot of fun!"
"Love Fenway park! I come from a place where a baseball stadium is a dome and does not represent baseball at all, so to go to a true baseball stadium is something of a dream come true. Everything was nice and clean and the whole atmosphere at a game is awesome. We loved the food and drink variety and how easy it was to get around. I hope I can come back again. Go Red Sox!"
"Fenway Park IS Boston, to me.  A summer isn't complete unless I've crowded into the park with thousands of other fans, paid $7 for a beer, and spent my evening waiting for my chance to belt out ""Sweet Caroline"" with the rest of Red Sox Nation.,This year, Fenway got even better with the addition of veggie dogs and veggie burgers.  I came to the park determined to try this new fare and I was not disappointed in what I found.  I had the veggie dog ($5) and it was much more flavorful than what I usually buy at the store.,Be aware, though: when walking along the ground floor concourse, I felt like I saw veggie burgers and dogs everywhere, but they are actually only at a few select stalls, so plan accordingly.  Also, the veggie burgers have to be cooked on a separate grill and take about 10 minutes to make, so you have to decide if it's worth missing another few at-bats.,Rock on, Red Sox.  But try to win next time, please?"
"I was in Boston visiting my friend so I had to go to a Red Sox game. With all of the history and what not behind the team I was willing to pay a good chunk for a ticket.,I will admit I love the history of the park. I will admit that after being spoiled from other great parks Fenway is ok. ,Small seats, pretty annoying fans are just blah. My friend and I ended up sitting in the concession area watching the game on the TV. Oh well. I'd most certainly be back."
"Fenway Park really seems to be getting better and better.  I am not a big baseball fan, but I still really find games here entertaining.  I brought my fiance as a surprise and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The screens are really easy to read, even from far away.  The concessions are clean and the lines are quick.  The bathroom even was pretty neat and clean.  The music was great and it was a good time.  We got the Coke Deck standing room seats for only $25 but took a seat after a couple left and offered them to us.  Even when we were standing, we had a lot of space and a pretty good view. ,We had a great time.  Even if you're not a fan of baseball or the Sox, Fenway Park is a good time."
Great park. Especially when the Yankees beat the Red Sox
"I'm a Phillies fan, but I love baseball and jumped at the chance to travel to Boston last April for the first home series vs the Yankees.  We had tickets in the right-field stands but the sun was so strong that 1) after the first inning I went down to the concessions and bought a blue Red Sox hat; and 2) after the second inning, we fled our seats for the shade of standing-room behind and above home plate.  ,That spot was a great place from which to watch the game.  There was a straight line to the field with nothing obscured by architecture or other patrons.  We got there soon enough to get right on the railing; in later innings the area filled up behind us.  ,I like the setup of having a little city of concessions on the ground level underneath the outfield stands.  That's a fun area in itself down there.  Plus, we found a beer vendor with good stuff--the Harp/Guinness/Smithwicks triad plus a few others--for only a dollar more than the regular crap beer, which I refuse to drink (yes, I am an unapologetic beer snob).  Hot dogs were good but nothing too memorable.,The Yankees-Red Sox series made for some great sights and sounds.  My favorite was a younger guy who was wearing a Sox Johnny Damon jersey t-shirt with the name ""Damon"" crossed out and ""Judas"" written in masking tape.  Hilarious.  The Sox won the game (hooray!) but I loved the crowd notwithstanding the outcome.  These people love a good time but they are not mindless, abusive partyers like the crowd at Wrigley Field.  They love and know the game of baseball.  Sure, they hate the Yankees, but they're not egregiously vulgar about it; they have fun with it.  In our standing-room area there was a girl decked out in Red Sox gear with her boyfriend in a Yankees jersey.  The surrounding crowd was letting him have it--and she was joining in--but he laughed and took it with good humor.,I don't often wear baseball caps, but I still have my Red Sox hat and usually wear it instead of my Phillies cap, which I keep pristine for Phils games."
My favorite place on Planet Earth.
"Fenway is a cultural landmark for both Boston and baseball.  The park has a great local feel that invites pre-game strolls and post-game celebrations.  I am especially fond of the post-game drummers on Lansdowne Street.  ,Besides being a cultural landmark, Fenway is a baseball lover's kind of park.  The fans know the game and are engaged from first pitch to final out.  The small-ish park gives the sense that you are involved with the action.  The tradition of score keeping is alive and well; a great activity for lone game goers.  ,I have sat in the bleachers, the right field grandstand, and on the Monster.  I would advise ticket buyers to avoid the grandstand unless they have made sure that their seats do not have severe obstruction from one of the beams in the stands.  You can check the obstruction level of any seat in the park before you purchase them on ,.   Even so, the grandstand seats are even smaller than seats in the rest of the park, so avoid this area if you have any big and/or tall people in your party.  The bleachers are a great value - very little field obstruction and reasonable ticket prices.  If you have access to Monster tix, you should absolutely use them.  This is truly one of the coolest experiences in baseball. ,The concessions are great.  Every Fenway goer should have at least one Fenway Frank and soft serve ice cream in a mini-Red Sox helmet.  The souvenir soda, with free refills, is an excellent value.  If you only have one beer at the park, try the Wachusett Brewing Company's Green Monsta IPA.  Long Trail and Samuel Adams anything are also great New England beers available in the park.  ,The bottom line: Fenway is a unique experience that true baseball lovers should seek out if possible.  Arrive early to enjoy the neighborhood atmosphere.  Have a Green Monsta IPA.  Check seat obstruction before purchasing tixs to ensure an awesome time."
"Sooo fun!!! Clean seats for such a big park!! Had a lot of fun and will be going back, not soon, but back :D"
"What a great surprise, after going to Wrigley, I thought that the perception of Fenway would be the same, ""i love it just because its old, even though its really outdated."" Taking a trip down Yawkey way and seeing how open it was with food to the left and shops to the right, reminded me of the outside of Camden (my favorite ballpark).  I loved the aura of the stadium, the concourse was huge and had concessions were everywhere.  The bathrooms were spacious and clean.  And what scoreboard they had, it was huge.  The bar scene was good at the end of the game, but the $5 cover was unnecessary.  You can easily get to this stadium from mass transit.  I have to really think hard on whether I rate this my favorite ballpark, just wish it didn't come with Boston red sox fans"
"Love love love this place!,Everyone who complains of small seats and bad views, get over it! This place is legendary, it's historical, it's what the pasttime is all about. ,I hope Fenway is never rebuilt! I love it just as it is!!!"
"Classic Old School Ball Park with a small homey feel.,Great food selections and almost all of the seats are close to the field.,Best Ball Park in the country. ,They don't get 5 stars because their beer prices are out of the ball park!"
Best stadium and baseball experience in the country. The surrounding area sets the scene and mood and it carries over to the confines.  There are some obstructed seats (I couldn't see the batter) but I still love the place.  Just need to sit in the Monster seats to complete the picture.
"I'm not a baseball fan but it was cool to be in the second oldest ballpark in the U.S. Plenty of walking space, cell phone charging stations available, and lots of food for purchase. It was easy to find a taxi after the game."
"I get that this place has ""history"" and stuff but it's collapsing. I sat right under the edge of the bleachers, and this weird suage-smelling liquid dripped on my hat, pants, jersey, hot dog, and water. Not to mention, they have too much self pride. They keep calling themselves ""America's most beloved ballpark"" but I've only heard Red Sox fans say that. I went to see Derek Jeter, which was the only good part of the game (besides the final score) but Red Sox fans kept swearing and yelling at HIM! What happened to #re2pect? They need to rebuild their stadium to make it nicer."
"back in my high school years, my first sweetheart thought this place was really cool and romantic so he took me here and i thought it was pretty nice. of course it is still a pretty darn good date spot nowadays and the best part is that it is free!"
"GREAT FOR STUDENTS/THOSE STRAPPED ON CASH. ,My first semester here in Boston, it was announced that there was ""Beard Night"" aka glue on, grow out, or stick on some hair to your face and you get in to a game for $1...best part? They didn't even collect the $1 because of the hoard of people and the seats were actually not half bad!! And that's how I was welcomed into Fenway park :D,When I first moved out here to Boston a little over a year ago, one of the main things my baseball crazed friends told me to do was hit up The Green Monster and Fenway Park. I confess that I definitely thought those were 2 SEPARATE things, but I've since learned my ways, fear not. It's very close to the heart of downtown Boston and super easy to get to via the T-public transport. It's strange to just walk around the neighborhood and suddenly have a baseball field stand before you, but that's exactly how Fenway works. ,It's got a rich history of being the oldest ballpark in the nation and over all I think they've done a great job of keeping that ol school feel. Compared to the newer, dazzling statiums elsewhere (Nor Cal), this seems to have stood still with time. A majority of the park is still wood and metal bleachers...but that's kind of what I actually LOVE about it. ,You won't find many stadium entertainment going on, no slides or kid playgrounds and what not--you're here to watch the field! I love that they've got all your classic foods served in fun Sox memorabilia...like getting pop corn and ice cream in a plastic helmet. It's really the little things that make it all so much fun :),The lost start is just me being on the fence about how I feel regarding its age. I think the feel of its rich history is definitely enhanced by leaving things all a bit old school, but at the same time, the stadium could DEFINITELY use some upgrades. Either in new seats, fresh coat of paint somewhere perhaps? Still a Boston must though on the check list!!"
"This was the coolest experience that I've had in a long time. Aside from the overpriced food, the tickets are too expensive and because it's a smaller park you get a great view at almost every angle. This was my first experience at Fenway still was really great to see David Ortiz hit a homerun. The food was pricey, but a Fenway Frank it's classic. There are some eateries around Fenway Park then I would suggest you go to before you go to the game. There are also many bars around Fenway Park that you can go to after the game. Also, they close down Yawkey Way during the game. It is quite a festival. There are many things to see, and looking at the history of baseball is a very special thing to do. There are a lot of historical figures references photos and paintings inside Fenway which give it an old school feeling. It's one of the oldest stadium still standing. It was built in 1903. Even if you're not a fan of the Red Sox, I would still suggest to go to a game just to be inside the park. It's something that won't be around forever."
"This place certainly has it's charm, but it certainly has an old feel. My cousin and I went to get some beer and nachos and of course we were carded by them. Then went over to the side to sip our beers a little before we walked up the stairs and spilled a fourth of the highly filled plastic bottles. We were then carded again while just standing there sipping our bud lights. I understand they're trying to crack down on underage drinking and/or drinking too much, but it was a little much for me. I did grow up around the Boston area, but now I am in Pittsburgh and honestly that is the stadium that brings me in to the games. It is a beautiful stadium here in Pittsburgh."
"Classic part of Houston. Whenever you walk around the waterwall, you really forget that you are in a major city.  Also, I like how whenever there is a televised sporting event in Houston, they cut to a scene of people around the waterwall for the background as they list their sponsors."
"Out of all the baseball parks I've been to, this one is the tits! Everyone so friendly... To a point where you share food and drinks with one another."
"Let me start by saying, I'm a Yankee fan through & through -- Navy blue & white run through my veins.  You'd think I'd have nothing but terrible things to say about our arch-rivals, however I'm a baseball fan, first & foremost.  That being said, I can appreciate the charm & character Fenway Park has.  After all, it is the oldest ballpark in America.,It's tiny compared to the cathedral that is Yankee Stadium, but then again, Fenway's over one hundred years old.  It's an intimate venue, steeped with so much history.  I spent part of the game walking through the halls, and I was not disappointed.  Fenway Park is a must for any baseball fan, regardless of where your loyalties lie.,I'm so glad I got to see Derek Jeter play here before he retired.  I just wish I was able to see Mariano Rivera last year.,Side note:  The Green Monster looks much bigger on television than it actually is."
"Who doesn't love a game at Fenway Park? I have been several times to watch the red sox and I've always had a good time. I just love the old time feel and I like how its sorta small so there isn't a bad seat. The drinks/food can get pricey but that's just like any event nowadays. There is always a feel good atmosphere which is nice. I like going in the summer just because the weather is perfect to sit back, get a little buzz on and cheer on the greatest team of all time :)"
"This is such an outstanding forum for a ball game.  Always fun to talk with visitors seated nearby.  We are spoiled by working at BU and being so close to Fenway that we forget what a thrill it is for first timers.  We finally found some healthy food options, by virtue of speaking with one of the Aramark supervisors at the park.  If you walk out to Yawkey Way (nearest to home plate), you will find Bon Me (Vietnamese food).  Honestly, the chicken was outstanding.  I skipped the roll and they gave me extra veggies.  My husband got the chicken sandwich and loved it.  Enjoyed it more than the chicken sandwich inside the stadium, which tends to be dry.   I have had the turkey meatballs inside the stadium and they are good.  I've also had the kale salad, right next to Bon Me, and it was good as well.  But Bon Me's chicken was great!  Ask about the sauce on the side, as it's got a bit of a kick.  I really liked it.  Don't forget to buy raffle tickets; they announce the winner in the 7th.  The money goes to a great cause.  Be sure to pay close attention during the ball game to avoid personal injury.   We were at last night's game when the poor woman caught the line drive right between the eyes and ended up with a mild concussion and plenty of sutures!  Heads up and out of your cell phones!"
"A must see on any trip to Houston. Great picture spot and within walking distance of the Galleria. Spend a few minutes, or relax, play on the grass and spend some time people watching and water listening."
"Great place to spend Independence Day.,The fireworks exploding over the water make this a special place to view the fourth festivities.,A fitting tribute to Thomas Jefferson as he stares across the tidal basin keep watch on the White House.,Inspirational quotes surround the inside wall and give us insight to this great American,to whom we owe much as the author of our Decleration of Independence."
Go Sox!
"Intimate setting in a walkable city. Don't tell me New Englanders aren't friendly. Watch us party at a baseball game. ,John Henry and the current ownership group have done amazing things with this old gem of a ballpark. And the service is getting better year by year. ,I would give five stars if I could just get a little more leg room. But, that's what you get with an old park."
"Great place to take visitors but it needs parking. Yeah you can walk across a field from the free Galleria parking which isn't too bad but you used to be able to park on the surrounding streets. Last I recall the little street to the west was chained off for some reason.,Transco/Williams, who cares. It's just bunch of energy companies.,Wikipedia: "
Our favorite ballpark.  I was happy to find a beer stand that sold Guinness. We've been coming here for years and love all of the new improvements.
Fenway park is my all time favorite baseball stadium. The life and love of the sport of baseball just erupts here and everyone loves big Papi David Ortiz whenever he comes to the plate. I am a huge Boston Red Sox fan and Fenway park doesn't disappoint. My dream one day is to sit atop the green monster and watch a game from up there. When and saw the Red Sox play the blue jays tonight and we had amazing seats along the first base side. The weather was perfect and it was an awesome game
Okay I've been to lots of parks and was not sure why everyone insisted I must take in a game at Fenway.  We called the park the day of the game and were able to get 6 tickets together.  The entire stadium filled up right before the first pitch.  And almost no one in our area left their seat the entire game.   Great vibe!!   I am now a believer that this is a must do when in Boston.  Game ended with a walk off home run with Boston winning!  You don't have to leave your seat as the hot dogs are brought  to you.
"I was sick as a dog, and so my husband planned our mini vacation through houston, and picked this as one of our stops. LOVED it. After the first moment of walking up to this beautiful waterfall towering above us, I couldn't help but giggle, grin huge and take as many pictures as I could. Wanted to sit down and just listen to the soothing sound of the water for a really long period of time, but alas, we had more things we needed to do. Bravo to houston for investing in beautiful public art- really a treasure in this city."
"Another memorial dedicated to one of the most influential presidents in history, Thomas Jefferson. ,To get the Jefferson Memorial is a bit long and might be out of the way when you see it on the map, but it is something all tourists must see. ,It's a nice statue of Thomas Jefferson and there are some quotes he has famously said. ,The bottom level has more facts about Thomas Jefferson, which tourists might not notice. ,During Cherry Blossom season, this is the ideal spot to see all the cherry blossoms and get a good view of it. ,The man who wrote the Declaration of Independence. One of original Americans and founding fathers. God Bless America!!!"
"I waited a long time to see my beloved Red Sox play a home game, and the trip was totally worth it.  From the time we arrived at the park, all of their employees were very nice and polite. Since I didn't want to miss a minute of the game, and I don't do hot dogs (nope, not even at Fenway), I can't comment on the food at all, but the experience was magical and totally lived up to the years I have had to grandize it in my mind.  The Red Sox win was the icing on the cake."
"I was not born or raised in Boston. Being an outsider that lived and loved Boston for almost 7 years, getting my chance to visit the amazing historical Fenway was beyond a dream come true. On many different visits I was favored enough to have different experiences and views of the grand ballpark. From walking around the stadium and getting to meet Jason Varitek before he retired. Touring the park and being allowed to sit in the press box, walk on the field and view the stands from all angles. As well as getting to have my picture taken with both World Series trophies, even though my eyes were closed. I was even invited to a game that my friend had tickets too. He handed me my printed ticket, we went through check in, grabbed beers and food. Headed to our seats for me to discover mine was to be the famous Ted Williams Red Seat. How lucky can one girl be?? I loved all my trips to Fenway! And remember them all with awe and wonder. I am an adopted Red Sox fan and Bostonian come rain or shine, wins or losses. I will die a Red Sox fan."
"Someone told me this was Houston's version of the Niagara Falls. Um, I thought everything was bigger in Texas? Guess not so with fountains!,It's nice enough, and yes, the park is pretty and the benches sure look nice, but considering simply stepping outside causes one to sweat profusely nowadays, I don't really have any desire to spend any sort of extended period of time out there."
"I wasn't supposed to like Fenway Park. ,It's tainted. It has a weird green wall! It's in the middle of Boston. And there's red EVERYWHERE. I hate the team that plays here with every fiber of my being, and why wouldn't I hate the building that houses them?,And yet ... there's no denying that this ballpark is gorgeous. Rooted in history and shaped by tradition (and that Green Monster), Fenway Park is one of those ""must-visit"" destinations for any baseball fan.,I attended my first game here in 2010 with my best friend, when we somehow got day-of walk-up tickets for NYY/BOS a couple rows behind home plate. The game was great: the score kept going back & forth, and hearts were shattered & repaired in a matter of minutes. My best friend and I both lost our voices by the 6th inning. The whole building was spilling over with energy and I loved every minute of it. The Yankees won (obviously!), but that's not even the most memorable part of the experience. You see, I've been to Fenway a few more times since that first game in 2010, and each outcome has not always been in my favor. But the one standout memory is this:,I felt lucky.,For whatever reason, walking into those stands, looking up at the Green Monster & the scoreboard & the smaller-than-you-think-it-is (read: intimate) stadium, you feel lucky to be a part of baseball history. Fenway *is* baseball history, and you find yourself wondering whether fans in the 80s, 60s, 40s -- even the 1920s -- felt the same way you do when you take in the view from your seat. ,Most of the newer ballparks lure fans in with gourmet foods, artisan cocktails, & luxurious accommodations. But some ballparks don't need any of that. Some parks make you feel lucky to take part in the experience of watching a baseball game ... and Fenway just happens to be one of those ballparks."
Absolutely best government service I've ever had. I got my passport in less then 20 minutes! Just make sure you have all your paperwork ready and proof of leaving within five days. Couldn't be happier!
"First time here and it was an awesome experience! Sat in the grandstand so the seats were pretty good. The food was great and not that expensive compared to other stadiums. ,I had the fenway dog which was good but nothing special. However, I also had the loaded skewer fries and my girlfriend had the regular fries. Both were amazing and enough to fill us up for dinner. ,The only bad part of the experience was that the parking hell-a expensive and the Red Sox lost. Can't wait until I come back here again, though."
"Just pure love. If you're reading reviews about Fenway Park, you're probably not from the area... If u're visiting, I say sacrifice a day of your trip and enjoy sitting next to a bunch of die heart sox fans! Drink lots of beer, sneak in a beach ball and learn the lyrics to ""Sweet Caroline."" ,If you hate the red sox, then don't bother going..."
"nothing beats a FREE refreshing attraction on a summer Texas day.,After you've dropped some dollars at the Houston Galleria mall, the next thing you want to do is sit down and eat. I recommend packing a picnic lunch, eating on the lawn, and letting your kids stand by the rushing waters to get a little breeze and mist from the waterwall.  And don't forget the camera (make sure its protected from the water - it won't get drenched but it will definitely leave little water spots on your lens),There is no designated parking for this attraction so I highly suggest parking in the Galleria lots. You'll have to walk to waterwall but its not that bad. It's literally right next to the mall so it should be a 5 minute walk at the longest."
Just breathtaking.... Can't say much about Jefferson except there are no politicians that come close to his brilliance and stature!
Clearly the Best Ball Park in the Country!  Due to the age it is a very unique place to visit that is rich in baseball history!  Aside from that there are the food venders that are both inside and outside of the park offer some of the best Sausages around. . Love to visit Fenway...
Wow!  What a park!  Definitely felt the love of the game and the local pride here.  We sat in the original seats.  I was comfortable but my friend who is taller than I am was cramped.  My only complaint was for the food vendor - The cheese balls were over cooked and had clearly been in the warmer too long.  Frustrating for how pricey vendor food is.
"An exciting event visiting this historical baseball park also known as the Green Monster.,We entered thru Yawkey and immediately we were hit with an electrical hum of energy.  Live bands playing, costumed crowd pleasers, food vendors line the street, and passionate Red Sox fans.,Immediately drawn by the smell of street food, we approach a Shawarma stand, which had the shortest line but does not diminish the tastiness of the beef kebob wrap.  I tried to positively Yelp about the food but I was unable to find them.  Other stands had long lines for traditional offerings such as the Fenway Frank and Cheese steaks.  There are a variety of restaurants near the action if seated eating comfort is preferred.,Out seats were a short walk from entry and a few rows behind the dugout.  I like how it feels as if the stadium has kept the integrity of the structure for over a century.  ,The seating area is tight and if you lean back you can easily touch the knees of the person behind you.,And of course the green all around.  Vendors ran up and down all aisles constantly and security was diligent in keeping order, which was comforting.,This is an arm hair raising event for any baseball enthusiast."
"How did I NOT write a review yet?!?!?!,Alrighty, first off don't hate my guts. I am a Bostonian, born and raised, and really really really loved my neighborhood (not). I never got in a fight, and I never got scurrrred....and then my dad said we're movin' to the 'burbs.,To add to the above, I'm not a Red Sox fan or a sports fan at all. I'll play football (soccer for us yanks), tennis, and badminton, but other than that, see ya....,I've been to Fenway Park for tours before, and then went to my first game ever about a month ago with hubs who's from Pennsylvania and well, let's not elaborate on how he feels about Boston sports culture...anyways...a coworker of mine offered us free tickets which we were excited about and had a very decent time. Every time my husband ran to take a leak he came back with beer. Gotta love him. We ate at the Lower Depths beforehand (check out my review for that spot - best place to hang out for food before a game...$1 hot dogs!!!) and only got snack-y things at the park. We had great seats - like 10-15 rows from home plate. ,I'd go back if I had free tickets...:)"
"Ok I hate this thing, but whatever, it's a Houston landmark, and I'm giving it four stars out of uncharacteristic feelings of guilt and peer pressure, not out of any affection.   There are much better things to see/do in this city, but everyone will flock to this thing anyhow, so I will present facts and links instead of my opinions.,Fact the first: When I first moved here, friends told me that the fountain was used to provide electricity to the building.  Though this had been told to them by fellow Rice comrades, this is not true.  It is just a fountain.  It does use recycled water.,Fact the second: The Williams tower, that tall thing that accompanies the fountain, is currently for sale as of the date of this review!  If you have a spare $500 million, you could own this water wall.,Fact the third: Though brides and students alike love to photograph this fountain, you are required to obtain a permit before taking photographs.  This means that if you look too professional, you may be chased off.  Not an idle warning; it happens all the time.  This is private property, after all, because that's the way we like things in Houston.,Fact the fourth: ""Both the fountain and tower were designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Philip Johnson. Construction of the complex was completed in 1983. The semi-circular fountain is 64-foot (20 m) tall and sits among 118 Texas Live Oak trees. Approximately 11,000 US gallons of water flow over both sides of the wall every minute.""  Thanks, wikipedia.,Fact the fifth: Someone at LSU wrote his/her reasonably interesting thesis about this park and its public/private relationship, citing lots of Heidegger; document currently available at "
"I attended a Red Sox vs Yankees game here as a gift from my wife. As a diehard Red Sox fan Fenway Park had always been on my Bucket list. I can honestly say this was the most amazing ballpark I've ever been to. There really is no place like Fenway. Our seats were right next to the field along the first base line. The view was spectacular. The energy at Fenway was electric. Getting to the ballpark was fairly easy (though crowded) on the subway. Fenway has plenty of restrooms that are accessible and noticeably more security present then other ball parks I've visited. Food and drinks are expensive ( to be expected)  Get a Fenway frank. It's a huge tasty dog. Fenway is a very nostalgic ballpark. singing Sweet Caroline during the 7th inning stretch was great. Fenway is a must for any baseball fan in general, but if you are a Sox fan it's worth every penny. The only thing that would have made the trip better was if the Sox would have won. We did however snag a foul ball of of DJ's bat."
"A functional, efficient, and professional government office staffed with competent and polite employees.  I'm pretty sure those words have never been used in the same sentence.  But believe it, yelp friends, this place is fantastic.  After procrastinating renewing my passport for too long, I needed to get it done on the quick and this is the only place (locally) that will get it done (within 2 weeks of your travel date, they check for proof!).  ,I made an appt and had all of my documentation in order and was in and out of there in less than a half hour.  Unfortunately, I had to come back the following week to pick it up, but my butt didn't so much as hit the chair in the waiting room before my name was called and I was handed my crispy, fresh passport.  Everyone was really nice to work with from the security screening folks downstairs to the guards patrolling the 18th floor to the peeps behind the glass.  If only all government offices could function like this one..."
"Yes I had fried clams before the game.,Yes I sat in the bleachers section as all bleacher creature fans do.,Yes I had a great time.,and YES WE WON.,Phillies lost, but the fans were great to listen to.  Who said the Sox fans are the only harsh critics.  ,Fenway is always a good time, and a great place."
"Fenway is more than a ballpark to me-it's a cathedral. It's seriously my holy place.,I first visited Fenway back in 2003, when my uncle brought me and my brother to a game. It was my first MLB game, and it couldn't have been at a batter park!,I fell in love with the place right away, as soon as I walked in the gate, smelled the hot dogs, saw the stands. Fenway is this amazing blend of modernity and reminders of storied of a game baseball is-after all, the park is over a hundred years old now!,Seeing that game in 2003 made me fall in love with baseball. I've been back 3 times since then, and every time it's just as magical as the last. I've sat along the first baseline (where I caught a foul ball off Pedro Martinez!) a few times, and sat in the right field bleachers the last time I went.,I haven't been since the new HD screens have been installed, but I'll be getting back as soon as I can. There's not other ballpark in the country like Fenway, and there will never be anything like it!,LONG LIVE FENWAY!"
"Parking is tricky here. You will have to park int the Williams tower garage. I believe $2-3 for up to 1hr? ,But this is a cool spot in the fallers to take visitors or to get a peace of mind. The big field to have picnics, walk around, or take pictures. Be prepared you can get wet from being sprinkled  from the waterfall.,Cool place for kids & adults."
"This memorial is a sight to behold during Cherry Blossom season with pastel trees surrounding the tidal basin.  Nothing frames the structure better than pretty pink flowers.,We saw the memorial both during night time and day.  Each provides a glorious view.  At night, you won't have to contend with the crowds.  After 9, the visitors have already dispersed, so you can enjoy the memorial with some peace and quiet."
"People can say how great Fenway park is but I'm an average size guy and the seats are so small they are unbearable. They make airline seats seem generous.,Going to a game is always a fun thing to do on a summer day in Boston though."
"First time @ Fenway Park! I must say, everybody in Boston love their teams. I had a great time watching the game. Got to see the famous ""Green Monster""  ,I highly suggest you guys to see a game live at Fenway Park whenever you guys are in Boston...that is if its still baseball season.,Regardless, Boston is always fun to visit!"
"A beautiful park tour on a beautiful day. While we didn't actually attend a game, I can speak to their behind the scenes tour. For $17 you're led around the park with an expert tour guide, who you can tell, absolutely love what they do. ,I hate when a ""behind the scenes tour"" isn't really behind the scenes. They show you things that make it seem like it's exclusive, but really, it's something anyone walking into the park could see. But this tour showed you around the media box (probably one of my favorites) and up on the green monster. ,It's really cool the special seating in the green monster, as well as the new bar area 4 seater options. Although with a lottery system and a high price tag to sit there, I doubt many people live to tell. Although, if I were a diehard fan, I'd be sure to enter in every year!,Lot's of facts were spewed out, but the most interesting was the single red seat story. Go on a tour and find out the story for yourself. Or google it. But really, go on the tour, it's much more interesting hearing it that way!"
"Such a great ball park! Great game for the 4th of July! I'm from Philly and accustomed to Citizens Bank Park, which has great food, so I was a little worried that I wouldn't like the options at Fenway...I was wrong! There were so many great foods to choose from! Everything smelled so good and really added to the experience. The kettlecorn was probably my favorite. ,We took my 5 month old son, his first game ever! I liked that they had a family restroom where my husband and I could both take him for a changing. We loved how the history of the park was displayed and how festive the side streets are. Tons to do in the area. Great experience overall!"
"Just the most charming, spirited ballpark there ever was. No other park ignites the same love and pride. Go sox!"
My little boy and I just moved to the galleria area and this was the first attraction we visited. It was not only gorgeous but such a fun way to cool off from this Houston heat!
"Awesome experience. If you want to get seats in th email shade, try getting tickets in the grandstand. FYI the bleachers are not actually bleachers. They've been updated to chairs with backs.,The food area behind the bleachers is great. $6 to get ice cream in a souvenir helmet, $8.75-9.50 for domestic and craft beers, and $5 for the amazing Fenway Franks. ,Make sure you stay to sing Sweet Caroline before the bottom of the eighth inning!"
"A couple years ago, I was in desperate need of extra passport pages. I was about to go out of the country, where I knew I would be doing even more traveling, and had a measly half-page left in my passport -- that would not do!,I came to the Chicago Passport Agency, and they had my passport plumped up within a day; I dropped it off in the morning, spent a few hours sweeping through the city, and picked it up in the afternoon.,They did a fairly shoddy job and it looks a bit goofy (new-style passport pages TAPED into an old passport), but I've been to 10+ countries since and never had any problems with it -- knock-on-wood."
Nice stadium but I got kicked out for being too intoxicated. Would go again but drink less beer.
"Been to several ball parks in my lifetime, not a huge amount a few and I think this is my favorite so far.  Being from Texas, I was raised going to the Astrodome which was an amazing place in it's time and was just uniform and did not have a bad seat.  It was also designed for many purposes to include football, rodeo's and the like.  ,This place, Fenway, has baseball history.  It was built for baseball and baseball alone.  There may be a bad seat, but you will love it anyway.,So why not 5 stars?  Well you know the bad seat thing, in all honesty, the old seats are fairly uncomfortable.  Not from a 'wide' perspective, all thought I did occupy ALL of the seat, it is the distance to the seat in front of you.  You can not sit straight."
"It is very easy in a big city like Houston to get caught up in city life. As we constantly move from one traffic jam to another, we are surrounded by the palpable air of the freeway -one part frustration, one part anxiety, and two parts fatigue. Walking up the muddy grass into the water wall you are instantly shielded from the harshness of city life.  You first notice the sound of rushing water, followed by the cool touch of the misty air. The semicircular structure recreates the serenity of a waterfall that should be tucked away, deep in the miles of a South American forest.  It serves in perfect contrast to the Williams tower, an embodiment of city life, directly across from it. The tower is big, steel, -glass, while the wall is small, made of stone and water. They are separated only by a hundred or so yards of grass. It is easy to callously mistake the Waterwall for a waste of space or find it underwhelming from a distance. However, the water wall is much more than a nice landmark for photos or picnics. It's an ethereal escape to a magical place void of the antagonistic aspects of city life.,Tips: Bring a frisbee."
"Amazing ball park filled with good eats, beers, and of course...the home of the Red Sox! Great area with nice bars and souvenir shops...nothing really to complain about."
"My 50-YR Relationship With American History,DEFENDING AGAINST TYRANNY OF ORGANIZED RELIGION,""Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity."" - THOMAS JEFFERSON arguing for the First Amendment's ""Separation of Church & State"" - 1787,SITREP,Growing up in D.C. gave me tremendous access to important historical monuments & buildings, but most important - IDEAS & EVENTS - that affected me deeply. Suffice it to say the Jefferson Memorial is my biggest touchstone to these memories.  And in some prescient way, seems eerily appropriate as the subject on the occasion of my 1000th Yelp review.,THE SETUP,The Memorial & Tidal Basin are (IMHO) the two most beautiful conjoined features of the D.C. landscape. The Memorial was completed in 1943 and the statue of Jefferson was added in 1947.,The Tidal Basin covers an area of 107 acres and is 10 feet deep evenly at all points. [As part of the 2012 redesign of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, water from the Tidal Basin is now channeled to fill the pool.],FROM A KID'S VIEW,Mom first took me here the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 when I was a 20-month old toddler. For her, Jefferson was HER touchstone of her own personal inspiration (something carried over into my personal philosophy of life). Thus when this tragedy struck, the Jefferson Memorial was a welcome sanctuary for her mind & spirit.,Unfortunately for her, it became a repeated act of painful decompression again & again, more profoundly in 1968, first after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April, and tragically again in June after the assassination of Bobby Kennedy.  As a child of six (6), the pain of these events was seared into my mind, both as my own memory, but also through the prism of her emotions. Bobby's death in fact broke her spirit since she was involved in his national Presidential campaign in D.C.  An energetic activist during the 60s, my mom lost her political passion after Bobby's death.,PILGRIMAGES,But trips to the Memorial continued, and became more important and more complex in terms of ""remembrance"" since so many things were being revered, so when I revisit the Memorial, there is a lot of personal meaning impacting me when I step up into the rotunda and walk around the Tidal Basin in cool reflection of the past.,A LIFE OF RESONANCE,It is thought-provoking to know that through this intricate nexus, Jefferson was one of Bobby Kennedy's political heroes, as BOTH were my mom's heroes, and as my mom and they are MY heroes.  So this memorial becomes much more to me than just a mere architectural edifice of marble & stone, but rather a wide flowing river of important beliefs of my own personal family history.,JEFFERSONS' DEISM,Tying back to my review's opening quote, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and James Madison were modern Deists - and unlike their more Christian theistic colleagues - such as George Washington, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton - they were avidly against the imposition of any organized religion and fought ardently for the concept of ""Freedom From Religion"".,For me the true testament of Jefferson's & Madison's constitutional genius & success is that unlike any other country during it's time, the United States in 1787 was the only country that did not have a State Religion.  And the Constitution has had to continue to be strongly defended in the face of Christian evangelical movements through TWO centuries that try to uproot the 1st Amendment.,The Constitution that they hammered out in Philadelphia is STILL the foundation that all freedoms - both declared at the time or later developed - are based upon.,*WARNING:  SPOILER-ALERT!  ADULT-CONTENT FOLLOWS!*  ;^D,Yet in spite of the exposition above, there are some ""lighter"" escapades in my association with the Jefferson Memorial. ,When in high school, it was an easy thing to merge my passion for historical wonder at iconic monuments with my more youthful lusts.  As a romantic stop, the Jefferson Memorial is da shit - for many, the Jefferson Memorial and surrounding Tidal Basin is a Lover's Lane of sorts.  There were many tender moments of intimacy that were experienced by me with a dear sweet girlfriend all over the Jefferson Memorial grounds.  All over..... out of view.... behind rotunda pillars.... in adjoining bushes...,In fact, it was hard back in the day to NOT trip over other young couples who also found the passion of their personal love so intertwined with this historical figure and his memorial.   So I found it amusing then, as I still do, that this marble & stone memorial can still be softened so easily by the laughter of young & old lovers alike.,THE LOWDOWN,A remarkable breath-taking memorial to a man, who for me, is the most important American Icon who ever lived."
This is in my hometown of Boston. Great place to watch a game. It is a classic ballpark and in my opinion the greatest sports experience in this country one can have . Gotta have a Fenway Frank and sit in the bleachers. It's what Boston is all about ! Go Sox!!
"Always an amazing place to come and see a game. The price was good for the seats, food and drinks inside are always a spike but that's what you get when you go to a sporting event in Boston they are all like that. The only thing they should do to the stadium is either change out the old style seats because no one fits in them anymore. Or please construct a new one and have this place as a relic."
"Fantastic. Love the Ball park, whether to watch with friends, a company outing or volunteering as a 50/50 raffle person. Nosebleeds seats are still amazing, especially when the sky is almost red. Scoreboard still updated by hand. Take a tour and soak up all the history displayed all throughout the park, have your wedding there or just come grab a hotdog."
"I was finally able to make a long awaited trip to Fenway.  Every time I previously had been to Boston, the Red Sox were playing road games or it was offseason.,Pros:,- It's the oldest Major League ballpark still being used,- The singing of Sweet Caroline in the middle of the 8th was an amazing experience.,Cons:,- Line of sight was not factored in when laying out the seating in this ballpark.  You have ground level sections that face center field.,- Obstructed views from posts and pillars.,- The Green Monster fence maybe iconic.  But let's not forget that it's the highest fence in any major league ballpark due to poor field dimensions.  I'm really not a fan of ""wallball doubles."",- Beer vendors don't sale in the seats,The visit to Fenway with a colleague was the highlight of my work trip to Boston.  I'm so glad I was able to see a game there.  But when I look back, Fenway stacks near the bottom of the ballparks I've visited when you considering it's not great for actually watching the game.  Fenway is historic.  But it also wasn't planned out very well which means it's not timeless due to oversights and quirkiness.  My hope is Dodgers stadium see more games played than Fenway because it's historic, timeless and still offers a quality experience for watching the game."
It would be so much more attractive and impressive without the silly afterthought of an arch-thing in front.
"I remember when I was planning our trip and the first thing that I put down for Boston was see the Red Sox play at Fenway Park. I went online and, luckily enough, they were playing the Rangers on one of the nights that we were there so I booked us good seats at $99 a pop I think... Might as well do it properly, right?,Going through our itinerary with my mates, everyone of them said they'd always dreamt of going to Fenway and I know what they were talking about now. It is such a great experience, one that I'll remember forever. I would have taken a tour if there wasn't a game on anyway, but being able to actually see a game there; it's awesome.... Cold crisp beer and a hot dog... ,'Papi' David Ortiz smashed it on the night and we (yes I am an aussie and a Red Sox fan! We want the cup back!) beat the Rangers. ,It's a different atmosphere to a footy game but it's still as amazing as! ,If you are ever in Boston and the Red Sox are playing, do yourself a favour and go see a game, it's something that you'll forever treasure!"
"Best. Government. Office. Ever. I have never had such an easy experience. There was a short wait, they were efficient, and I got my passport the same day! If you're going for same-day passport services be prepared to wait a few hours but the wait is totally worth it! The staff was polite and accommodating. I've read some complaints about the security guards however we had nothing but smiles from the security that was there today. The whole government should run this way."
"It's loud. It's crowded. It's uncomfortable.,But you'll have the best time of your life.,I always tell people that I have been everywhere in this country that's worth a damn to visit. Fenway is by far my favorite place. On earth. It helps that Massachusetts is my homeland and I'm a crazy Sox fan, but even if you're only a fan of baseball, history or America, you'll still love Fenway park.,Can't get there for a game? Don't worry! They do tours year-round so you can still get into the ballpark. No excuses."
"Fenway Park is quite simply the most nostalgic, intimate, and incredible sporting venue in the United States...and perhaps in the world.  There is simply no other place like it.  It doesn't matter if you are fortunate enough to call the home team your own here or not, EVERYONE who cares about sports at all should make a visit to Fenway at some point!,The Red Sox have my allegiance, but Fenway Park stole a piece of my heart on its own!"
"Yes, it's one of the best places to take out of town visitors.I honestly can't remember a time I've had friends in for a visit to Houston that we haven't gone there for some photos  It's a great place for photos. The large green space between it and the Williams Tower is a serene place for family picnics or to toss a Frisbee. ,But since thy've taken away all the street parking and made getting to it and stopping for even a few minutes for those touristy pictures it's not my favorite place to show out of town guests how friendly and fun Houston can be.,Stand inside and let the mist cool you off during the heat of Houston's summer. However, I don't recommend the waterwall when hungover as they angles and effect of the water falling can be a little unsettling!"
"I'm not much of a baseball fan and I don't give two shakes about the Red Sox.,But I did, however, enjoy Fenway.  Growing up going to Tiger Stadium, I have a soft spot in my heart for the old stadiums.  The big new ones are too flashy and distracting for my taste.  Yes, I'm totally that nerd who gets excited by a real organ.,Another part that I enjoyed was the low tolerance for rowdy behavior.  Maybe it was because we were sitting in nice seats, but when the drunk guy behind us kept dropping f-bombs and loudly heckling the players, he was escorted out of our section.  Yes, I'm also that nerd who doesn't think drunk loudmouths are entertaining.,The best tip I can give (and one I picked up from a stadium hot dog vendor) is go out on the pedestrian promenade and get an Italian sausage with peppers ($5!).  Much tastier than a plain hot dog."
"Really loved the time I spent at this memorial. We happened to visit just as a Park Ranger tour was about to start, so we decided to join in. What a decision! Our tour guide (Park Ranger Grissom!) was amazing, informative, & funny. He asked where we all were from, & listed off a few National Parks in each of our respective home states. He told us a little about the construction of the memorial, Jefferson's life, & maintaining the monuments around Washington DC. The tour only took about ten minutes, and I think they have several per day, so I highly recommend taking some extra time to learn a little bit extra about this important part of US History.,The room itself was gorgeous, moving, & calming. Designed in such a way that allows a cool breeze, which doesn't seem important unless you visit on the hottest day of the year (like we did). It's open on four sides, and the views of the water & surrounding monuments are breathtaking.,Downstairs (yes, there's a downstairs!) there is a short video about Jefferson's contributions to the country as well as a detailed timeline of his life & accomplishments. Restrooms are downstairs as well. There is also a gift shop, where you can buy Jefferson memorabilia for the Presidential enthusiast in your life.,It would be quite a walk to get to the Jefferson Memorial from the National Mall, so it's easiest to get here by car -- there's a couple of designated parking lots a short walk away. This is apparently also the location of the Cherry Blossom Festival every year (which I'd love to see one day!), so there is a small refreshment stand close to the Monument where you can buy snacks & cold drinks.,I really, really loved visiting this monument. It might be my favorite monument in Washington DC! Definitely worth a visit -- and make sure you stay for the tour!"
"Very historical baseball park. I'm used to Nationals Park here in DC and Fenway is much smaller, but has a more historic feeling to it. Only downside is I wish they had more unique food options.. everything was so expensive and the food options were very plain."
"AMAZING, this stadium is so amazing, everyone enjoyed the time here at Fenway, I am from So Cal but I'm a Red Sox fan and Dodger stadium has no comparison to Fenway park, I was here for the Halloween special for kids, I got to walk the field and see the stadium from the field instead of the stands, I had a flight and so they allowed me to enter with my suitcase and backpack, great staff and amazing history here at Fenway Park. I'm glad I was able to visit the oldest stadium in MLB"
"Love the entire experience of Fenway!  Could the seats be a little bigger...yup, could there be a more diverse food selection...you bet.  However, there is nothing like spending a day at Fenway.  It truly is an event.  The best is taking family and friends who have never been and watching them take everything in as they check Fenway off their bucket list."
"Those who fail to appreciate the beauty found in Houston's most striking fountain have aesthetic judgment akin to those who think the Parthenon an old junk heap taking up space that would be better served for upscale condominiums with a fabulous view of Athens.,""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" is a phrase with which most of us are familiar, but I tend to agree with Kant who suggests that real beauty is objective and universal. Hence, those who fail to appreciate it must be deficient in some essential quality that makes us human. But enough of my philosophical prattle - the waterwall's intrinsic beauty is well worth your while to see.,It is surrounded by hundreds of live oaks which obscure it enough to make the passing motorist want to stop and get a better look. Park in the free Galleria lot located a block away to the West or risk towing.,If you approach it from the Transco Tower (which will always be known to Houstonians as the Transco Tower in spite of the current owner's insistence on calling it the William's Tower), the Romanesque proscenium is dwarfed by the 64' tall fountain but conceals enough to continue to whet your appetite to see more of what is visible through its three arched openings.,Passing through the proscenium, one finally can appreciate the experience its designers must have intended. It's as if you were an actor in an ancient Greek theatre standing in the orchestra and surrounded by the semi-circular ""theatron"". But instead of an audience, you witness the magic of thousands of gallons of water cascading in sheets down sheer walls and then over descending steps terminating at your feet. It is an experience that engages all the senses and can result in a really bad hair day as you are slowly but inexorably inundated by the mist.,Depending on the weather and sunlight, the experience is always unique. Coming at night to witness it under dramatic lighting creates a different sort of magic altogether.,""The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility."",-- Attributed to Immanuel Kant"
"Is it a shock that this is 5 stars?  It's baseball history.  And a ballpark experience that is unparalleled.  They have a wide variety of food/concessions here (or at least it seems to me, a frequenter of Oakland Coliseum....).  I found ball game tickets to be a bit steep - I paid $25 a piece for bleacher seats on StubHub (this was slightly cheaper then box office prices) - and tickets go way-up from there.  BTW, I don't recommend bleacher seats - unless you like sunburn from sitting in no-shade in 3+ hours.  I would splurge on better seats if I was to go again.  Besides the park itself, what got me was the atmosphere surrounding it.  It truly felt like a walk-back in time."
"You know for a government agency these folks have their shiz together.,Seriously awesome how nice and helpful all the people I dealt with were.,Both the woman who received me at the front as well as the teller who actually handled my business they were seriously the nicest and most helpful of any government employee I've ever met.,While I hope my first visit was my last its not because I had any sort of bad experience. Very straight forward and my teller even ran to get me before I got on the elevator because she noticed I had done something on my check that had been an issue previously and she didn't want me to have any problems.,Awesome!,Easily the best experience of this type I've ever had."
"Visiting the park from sf Bay Area. It's Fenway, it's classic! Great sight lines. Snack bars are efficient.... Vendors are abundant (they really sound like bottom vendors) and ushers are extremely helpful. The team? They're not the Giants but we cheered for the sox and they won? But....it is the 21st century, can't we get some wifi?"
"Best park in America ! ,However park is absurd. Take the T- Kenmore stop.,There's always day of game tix around $5 or so except Yankees games"
must see!!!!!!
"I spent a lovely evening here in the arms of a beautiful woman. Surrounded by the rush of falling water and the soft glow of lights we couldn't help but begin to dance and shortly there after we were both on the ground laughing after my feet slid out from under me on the wet stone surface.,This is a great greenspace within the city limits, though the nearby construction detracts from its overall appeal, its better in the evening light and shared with either someone special or good friends."
"There are two schools:,Old School: embrace history, hold onto archaic traditions, old fashioned, and do not like change.,New School: modern, hip, and constantly evolving.,I sit on the fence between both schools - I respect tradition and love history, but change is necessary.  The manual scorecard is charming (but outdated), I hate the small uncomfortable seats, the stadium needs better concessions (you can keep your peanuts and crackerjacks), and I couldn't believe some of the sight lines.  With the park only holding 37,400 people, it might be time to build a new park (or completely overhaul the old one)."
From the marble columns to the 19 foot statue of Thomas Jefferson - it is definitely 5 star worthy.
"Good memory with Mia Woo. Biking in the area was fun. It was National Cherry Blossom Festival, we watched the ducks in the water and enjoyed tender breeze from tidal basin. The memorial itself is very informational and it;s architectural style reminds Mia of German People's Congress."
"Seriously. One beer vendor ruined a great experience.  Beer sold separate from food so waited in 2 separate lines. Finally get to front of beer line and lady told me she couldn't serve me without ID. REALLY?  I've been old enough to drink for 39 years and unquestionably look older than 21. That was simply uncalled for and ruined what started off as a great night. ,Lady, go work at McDonalds.....there was no excuse for that behavior!"
"There are few places I've walked into in my life with such energy. For baseball enthusiasts, this is a fully-operational holy shrine, not just to America's pastime, but to all that is good and right in the world. Yes, that's an accurate description of how I felt when walking into Fenway Park for the first time. ,As a west-coaster, I was convinced that AT&T Park was the best ballpark to exist. I have to amend that belief and say it's the best modern ballpark. Fenway is a living representation of a bygone era. It's small by baseball stadium standards, imperfectly designed (the green monster) and shoved in the middle of a city whose planners had no idea baseball would become such a large part of the American psyche. ,I was upset that ticket prices were double that at AT&T for bleacher seats until I realized just how intimate the place is. There truly isn't a bad seat in the house. I was even more convinced I'd scored a bargain when I got a tall beer and a Fenway frank in my hand. The combination of those elements, coupled with the satisfying crack of the bat from the field below got me all mushy inside. ,This is a living monument that any baseball fan should plan to visit when in the great city of Boston. It really doesn't matter who is on the field.  ,Important tip: Bathe yourself in sunscreen if you're sitting out there on a hot summer day or you will suffer the consequences."
"I'm watching the Red Sox play and just finished writing another yelp review. Almost as a joke I checked to see if Fenway as a destination had been yelp reviewed. Somehow it is and here I am.,    First off, one has to wonder 'How do I review and rate a Cathedral? Well the star rating is simple (5/5), but the explanation is a little bit trickier.,     Nothing individually at Fenway is better. Fenway Park isn't the cleanest ballpark out there, it isn't the most comfortable, and the food and drinks are terribly over priced. The seats get so tight you may or may not wonder if the man next to you/under you in a Red Sox t-shirt is Santa Claus.,        However, Fenway Park is a cathedral to the sport of Baseball. It is unique and special. There is a feeling of warmth that permeates every moment spent there and it can't be replicated. Something about the aged wooden seats makes the park gives the park a feeling of being genuine. It gives us a link to the past.,      For this reason Fenway Park stands apart from not only other ballparks but apart from other sporting venues. Everything in Fenway Park feels so much more powerful than it could feel anywhere else. The food tastes better, the beer goes down smoother and summer feels like summer when you're at Fenway Park.,       You might be sitting half on top of the guy next to you and your shoes might be stuck firmly to the ground, but for a few hours there's nowhere you'd rather be. Unless your stuck next to a Yankee fan."
"I love tourists!  I mean, is there anything more adorable than a bunch of people huddled around and wearing their geekiness on their sleeve?  Camera--check.  Fanny pack--check.  Ridiculous t-shirt you got from the last city you visited--double check.,Unfortunately, the Transco Fountain isn't just for tourists, so it isn't nearly as much fun to people watch.  Instead, you'll get snuggling couples, prom groups, and people with nothing better to do with their time (me).  What could draw such an eclectic crowd?  Maybe it is the cascading water that mesmerizes you.  Maybe it is convenient location next to the Galleria (hell, if you fought the traffic that much to get a spot, are you really going to leave without stopping here first?).  Or maybe it is in hopes that we'll see some more red food dye in the water.  Just maybe. ,I found myself so enthralled my first visit that I immediately brought my mom and sister when they came down for a visit.  They were equally impressed.  It is a lot of fun to see what fun things can go up when rich people have money to spend.  Yes, the parking can be tough with the Nazi security guards threatening to tow, but it is well worth it--if only to see his tubby butt chase after you for parking illegally."
"A ballpark you must check out in your lifetime for hardcore as well as casual baseball fans.  ,I was lucky enough to see the red sox play the tigers here last summer and here's my experience:,To get to the park i took the subway which is easily accessible for boston fans.  I'm sure this is the easiest way to get to and from the park.  I got to the park about 2 hours before first pitch mainly because i wanted to check out yawkee way.  I would have to say yawkee way was a pretty cool experience with lots of fans, music, food, and shops.  I was excited about trying one of those sausages from those outside venders but after trying one i was pretty disappointed with how dry the sausage was....,About 1 hour before game time the park opened up and i was finally able to check out the inside of the park.  For a park built in the late 1800's to early 1900's the red sox have done a great job making this park classic with all the modern amenities such as the large HD jumbo tron.  My seat was in the right field section of the bleachers and overall i was pleased with the sight lines.  One thing I didn't like was the fact that there wasn't a drink holder...but i guess that makes sense considering the space and how old the ballpark was.  ,As for the food inside, i can honestly say the sausage i had inside the park was way better then the one i had outside the park with those vendors.  the ballpark sausage was much juicer and full of flavor.  ,Overall, I was glad to check out this park especially during a game.  A classic ballpark that i hope remains up for many years to come."
"After responding 'yes' to a invitation for a friends wedding happening at the end of the month in Toronto, I realized my passport was expired and I had to go to the passport agency for expedited service.  I made an appointment over the phone, filled out the proper forms and showed up early in case there was a line.  The office doesn't open until 8:45 Am but there were already people waiting in line at 8:30.  Once the line started moving, it was efficient and the security team was clear with their instructions.  Everyone was surprisingly calm and patient, which seems to be the key to the line moving quickly.  I wish it was like this at the madhouse we call O'hare.  Once I got up to the 18th floor, I was asked for my confirmation number.  Don't forget it because the guard turned away at least two people while I waiting to see someone.  When it was my turn, I handed over all my information to the extremely friendly govt employee, a few questions about my trip and $170 ($110 renewal fee and $60 expedited fee) I was done.  I was expecting to be there hours but it took a total of 45 minutes from security downstairs to confirmation.  The estimated time for my passport to arrive in the mail was 10 days but it arrived in 4.  Everything went so smoothly I still can't believe this is a government office."
"C'mon, it's FENWAY PARK. No need for words here, just respect the 5-star rating and move along."
"As far as ballparks go I had a great time at Fenway park.Ive completed my baseball stadium tour and it ranks in my top three ballparks.Atmosphere is great for baseball fans yawkey way , bars, and fans are awesome."
"BF took me here on our second date over 12 years ago so this place is one of my favorite. Since our move into the suburbs further away from the Galleria, we still try to go a couple times a year. ,Nothing special, really. It's a nice place for pictures, though.,Since I started working in the Galleria, I get to see this site every day from my office building. When the water falls, it's pretty. When the water if off, it's just another structure.,Our company had a picnic here some Fridays ago and we were told by their security guard to not have any chairs on their grass. Yet, a few Fridays later, they had riders on horses (from the rodeo) galloping all over the grass."
"It's really not fair of me to write this review. I've been a life long Sox fan, which definitely makes me a bit biased. Walking into this stadium immediately gives me chills...The history in this building (even though the look of it may have changed a bit) is incredible.  Yes, some of the seats may be a bit tight or not quite facing the right direction, but that's just the charm and history of all that is Fenway. ,This stadium is a great place to watch a game (as long as you're not stuck behind one of the steel beams in an ""obstructed view"" seat) and to really get a feel of what it means to be a baseball fan.  The vendors shouting about their wares, whether it be a hot dog, peanuts, or cracker jack, will keep your belly full and your wallet empty for the entire game.  Yes, it's a bit expensive and the thought of bringing a family of 4 to watch a game makes me break out in a sweat, but there are much more expensive stadiums out there. ,The fan base is amazing, the history is irreplaceable, and the overall feel of the stadium is truly a unique experience."
"Another historic site that you have to visit if you are in Washington D.C.,I am wow & wow when I see the memorial. It is so unreal when I am really looking at the status in person. ,Once I walk up the stairs.... people inside the memorial tend to keep quiet for showing the respect. ,The place is kept very clean and maintain very well."
"Baseball history is alive here!  We took the tour and went to a game in the same day!  The yard itself is relatively small, so it fosters a very intimate atmosphere.  Some staff were very open and receptive to seeing SF Giants fans walking around at the Red Sox Phillies game, others looked at us like we were lost.  ,The tour was about an hour long and provided great detail to the park and the ball club.  I found it to be a great baseball history lesson.  They move at a pace that allows you to take pictures of the park and ask questions.  ,We didn't have much to eat here, just the normal hot dog, soda, and ice cream.  It was regular ballpark fare, nothing special.  ,Our seats were awesome!  We sat in row three of the family section, which doesn't allow alcohol consumption!  No drunk morons!  THANK YOU!  Red Sox won, Phillies, suck.  We bonded with Red Sox fans over World Series droughts and anti-Phillies jokes.  Having stayed in Boston for a week that trip, I wish I was able to make it to more games!"
"I am a Giants fan to my last gasp of oxygen...but. I do have a fondness for the Redsox. As a kid I just adored Yaz, Petrocelli, Tiant, Fisk....and so many more.,Plus this ball park is History. So many have been torn down that it is nice to see the real deal.,Plus who doesn't love the Green Monster???"
It's baseball.  In Fenway.  I don't know how anyone who is a fan of the Great American Pastime could visit and not be blown away.  Watching bombs fly over the green monstah...  eating a Fenway Frank (or three)...  A truly special place.
Sox are out of the playoffs and they are playing like it. Still a great experience to b in Fenway watching a pro game. The low star rating is for the sox level of play and not Fenway it's self. The fan photo people didn't come around much.
A boston staple its small but it has class and history to it soo many great plays great games concerts hockey and football games i think the best baseball field in the mlb
the security guard runs out to me and yells at us because he thought I was a profeshional photographer and he was like you need to go now!!!!   WTF!!
"I don't understand the hype...,there's nothing spectacular about this ""landmark""."
"Friendly Fenway.  Today, the whole right field area, Bud deck, roof box seats, all peanut free.  Great!  Wish we knew the days and locations in advance.  Beautiful day and nice seats and view.  Wish everything was not soooooooo expensive.  We do LOVE Fenway though."
"Extremely helpful, organized and employees were actual friendly and had a sense of humor... Unheard of for a government agency!! Great job Chicago passport agency"
"As a Yankee fan it's sacrilege for me to even be writing this review, much less giving Fenway five stars, but I came here for a Zac Brown Band concert in June and had a phenomenal time. ,In terms of the facilities, it's almost on the opposite end of the spectrum as Yankee Stadium, but it has a lot more charm and obviously, history. The area outside of Fenway is a ton of fun and there were lots of places to hang out prior to what ended up being an amazing concert."
"Beautiful place to just sit and relax after a long day of shopping. There were no parkings near or at least none that I saw so I just parked at Nordstrom and walked over. The weather was nice, a little humid but standing next to the waterfall felt so good!"
"I'm from NYC and my husband lived in Boston for several years. He is a diehard Red Sox fan. While on a weekend trip there, we took our 3 month old to her first game at Fenway. ,First of all, your little one gets a goody bag for baby's first game! How adorable is that? Just go to fan services and ask. My daughter got a pin, a tiny packet of Fenway dirt, a bracelet, and some other stuff in a cute little bag tied with a ribbon. ,Next, us being the first time parents we were didn't realize how cold it would be that time of year. So, I made it half an inning before I needed to seek shelter from the freezing cold and wind. I went to fan services and asked if there was a store open that I could sit in. The sweet woman at the desk said that wouldn't do and asked a young man to escort me to the Champions Club. I got to stay in there and watch the game from the warmth of their leather couch for the rest of the game! It was really nice. My husband and our friends froze their asses off on the field though, haha. ,Overall everyone is very friendly, professional, and courteous.,They were also very nursing mother friendly, which is more than what I can say about crappy Citifield here in NYC."
"One of my favorite memorials simply because it isn't as popular as the Lincoln Memorial so the crowd is smaller here. It's on the tidal basin which makes for a great stroll. You can visit this one and walk alongside the water to the MLK Memorial and the FDR Memorial (my all time favorite in DC). ,There are bathrooms at this memorial and if you need an escape from the tourists, go to the back of this memorial and dangle your legs off the side and have some good introverted time. ,Note: The one downside is that this memorial is aging and the green stains on the walls and cobwebs on the ceiling are testimony to that. Despite this, it still is a great memorial."
"This is my first review in what I hope to be a series of reviews for all 30 ballparks. Please hold me accountable. ,Although I've been to a few other ballparks so far, this has been by far my favorite experience. No it's not the biggest ballpark. Yes, it could use a little updating here and there. But the ballpark's storied history, the contagious energy of the fans and the authenticity of the ballpark food make Fenway a truly remarkable experience. ,If you have the time, I would highly recommend taking the tour of the stadium prior to the game. We did the regular tour ($16/adult). The tour guides were highly knowledgeable (and actually pretty entertaining). They take you through some of the history of Fenway and the Red Sox, and also take you up to the seats above the Green Monster. It goes without saying, also, that it is pretty cool to see the ballpark completely empty. ,Upon walking up to the ballpark, there are various food vendors lining the street along with a live musical act (or two). It feels like walking down Bourbon St., except with a baseball game on the side.  ,Our seats were in the outfield. Because the ballpark is one of the smaller ones, I don't think there are any bad seats in the house. If you want to sit on top of the Green Monster, you can enter a lottery (which I think happens every February) in order to get the opportunity to purchase a ticket. ,One of my favorite things about visiting different ballparks is seeing how the food varies by region. And Fenway does not fail. Where else can you sip on a cup of hot chocolate and then slurp up a warm bowl of New England clam chowder? Granted that the clam chowder is not the best clam chowder you could get in the city - but it does the trick on a cold, chilly day. ,One of my favorite foods was the Italian Sausage dog (made by Kayem). It is about 10 inches of sweet, juicy sausage on top of a bed of grilled onions, stuffed in a hot dog bun. The combination of the sausage and onions was just perfect. The bread was nothing too talk about - but the sausage... mmmmm mmmmm. ,Some of the other foods I saw were barbeque sandwiches, pot roast sandwiches, churro bites, tacos and quesadillas, italian ice from Luigi's and pizza from Papa Gino's. I've also heard that the hot dogs are supposed to be one of the best out of all the ballparks - but having just had the aforementioned Italian sausage dog, I felt that a regular hot dog would leave me just a tad bit disappointed. ,Overall, a great experience, if maybe on the more expensive side. Beers were about $8-10. Most of the food items were about $7-$10. But for the experience, I would definitely come back again."
"It's only one of two remaining baseball cathedrals, so what's the big deal? Seriously, it is a great place to watch a game. Easy transit, friendly fans unless you like NY.  Lines a bit long. Completely charming. A great place and a must see for baseball fans,I would give it 5* except if I hear Sweet Caroline one more time, I think I will throw up in my cornflakes. Yeah they were the original, place to use the song as kitsch, I suppose, but it is still badly shopworn. Move on"
"Seriously, how can you not give Fenway 5 stars? It's FENWAY! This place is kind of like the Holy Grail for baseball lovers (regardless of your preferred team). While in Boston for a short vacation in August I saw Red Sox vs. Indians. There is something about being in Fenway Park that is intoxicating (and no I'm not talking about the beer). The place is wonderful, the fans are great, and the team is hard not to love. Nuff said."
"Fenway is different than other ballparks. Yes it's smaller than other places and the seats are smaller than what other places offer. But Fenway is more than just a ballpark. To me, it's like a staple in Boston.,Living in Boston while going to school at Boston University, I was really lucky to live in Kenmore Square, right by Fenway Park. I love the whole experience of going to Fenway (Yes it helps that I am a RedSox fan). Getting peanuts thrown at you because the sellers want to add their own entertainment, smell of food and beer, and the crowds. They definitely add to the charm of Fenway."
Great place to bring out of towners or taking pictures.  This Houston staple has been here for years and has so many memories for so many people. It's great to come at night when it is illuminated!
"The one point off is because my wife is a die hard Yankees fan and would kill me for scoring it that high. However, I wouldn't disrespect this place with giving it a bad review of any kind. ,The history of this place is nice. I actually enjoy that it isn't so so huge and impressive. It's actually quite small compared to some of the newer parks with thousands of more seats. Speaking of seats...man, they are snug here. We definitely lucked out that we had a kid on my right and a woman on my wife's left. I would warn you to be careful if you have a huge person beside you. Or if you yourself are a huge person. The seats are SNUG. ,We got seats in the bleacher section to watch the Sox play the Angels and they weren't bad at all. Unless you get some huge person in front of you or next to you, the view and seats aren't bad. We got to see just about all the plays and for a 7pm game it was shady right before sunset. ,I'm already planning another visit before the season is over."
"(This is not much of a review, but more of an FYI.),*Edit*,When your passport has 3 months left before it expires, you cannot travel to the Philippines.  You could try to book an appointment for passport renewal for emergency international travel plans. Unfortunately, when an immediate family member passes away, and the next appointment available is not until a day after the funeral, it leaves one in a bit of a predicament."
"Love the sights, smells and sounds! Always love seeing a redsox game at Fenway park. Have also gone to the Frozen Fenway hockey game. The tour of Fenway is also highly recommended."
This is an experience everyone visiting or living in Houston should try at least once..Located in a really nice part of town the Waterwall is a great place to cool off and maybe have a picnic. I am new to Houston but the wall is located in a grassy knoll at the base of one of Houston's tallest buildings. When you enter the exhibit you will get hit by a blast of mist and if you stay in there too long you are bound to get drenched. I would go inside for a few minutes and then run out and lay in the sun to dry off. If you go in with cute hair just know you will leave with crazy frizzy hair (or maybe that is just me).
"This is place is LEGEN-wait for it-DARY. When my friends and I first decided to take a vacation to Boston, the first thing we all agreed on was going to a Red Sox game at Fenway....and they're Rays fans. ,We scored some seats through Ace Tickets and had a wonderful time. This place has history, and you can definitely feel it in your seats and walking around Fenway. The energy, the people, the food- it's all so different from other baseball games I've been to. ,I should make a note- for those that have seats under the roof, in the shade, it can get very cold. I had to go buy a blanket at Fenway (which set me back about $50). The people in the sun were warm and toasty, but once we got under that roof, the wind was so freezing cold. ,We were so lucky to be there during the longest game so far this season. We really got our money's worth and had a fantastic time. Go Red Sox!"
"TJ designed it himself.  Come at sunrise if you can, it's lovely as all get-out."
You have to hit this for a 5 just for its sheer patriotism to our country. Breathtaking and humbling take the walk to see it!
"While not a huge fan of baseball, just about everyone has heard about Fenway Park.  So, we decided that we would have to visit it.  Unfortunately during our visit there were no games scheduled; however, we did discover they do tours every hour.,We loved the tour.  It was interesting, informative and well guided.  You got to see everything, from the visitor's changing room, to the press box, to standing on the field and going on the big green monster.,The tour is affordable, but offers you the rare ability to see this gem when it isn't filled with people and as a result you can get great photos of the stadium how few get to see it."
"If you have a bucket list, put this on it. Some Red Sox fans are annoying as hell, but hard not to have a good time at the game. Aesthetically, just an amazing piece of history."
"Awesome stadium with so much history. ,Would be a great place to tour in the offseason."
"Just wonderful. ,Before you even set your big toe inside the stadium, you will be swept up into a wonderful festive atmosphere. The streets around the stadium really are like a festival- with music and stilt-walkers, and street performers, and an amazing amount of scrumptious food. ,And when you walk inside - there it is - the Green Monster in all its glory.,I was here on a Saturday afternoon against a mediocre Seattle team. The Sox are buried in last place.........and every seat was taken, the place was packed. It was like Happy Hour for three hours.,If you can't enjoy yourself here, something is truly wrong with you."
Checked this off my bucket list!
"Also known as the Williams Water Wall, the Transco Fountain is a beautiful site for locals and visitors alike in Houston.,When you go to the small park, you'll understand why so many people use this place for special occasion photos and simply to picnic or read a book.  ,Seeing the Fountain during the day is certainly a must do but you also need to do yourself a favor and check it out at night.  With the lighting in the evening, it is one of the more romantic spots in Houston. ,Biggest issue is parking since it is down in the Galleria area but something will turn up if you don't mind a little hike to go and see the Fountain.  Plan to spend your time just enjoying the splendor of this beautiful piece of architecture in the heart of Houston."
"Ben Affleck said it best when he called Fenway ""the cathedral of Boston"" in the screenplay of The Town.,This is one of my happy places. I love baseball. I love the Red Sox. I love that I can get on the T and ride to one of most beloved and historical ballparks in the country. So the food's overpriced--bring your own. So the seats aren't that comfortable--sorry princess. Bring a pillow. You can grab $12 grandstand tickets up through the 2nd or 3rd inning, and hey, they ain't half bad. If you're lucky enough to find yourself in one of the more hoity-toity seats, live it up. You earned it, champ. You earned it.,The staff love to be there. The players love to be there. The fans love to be there. The Green Monstah is epic, and I doubt you can get chowdah delivered to your seat at Shea Stadium or somewhere crummy like that. Any day of the week, I'll take a Red Sox game over many other activities. Hint, hint."
"I was at the airport on Sunday, Dec 22, when I learned that my passport had expired a month prior. :( The airline gave me great advice and I went to this passport agency the next morning (arrived at 6.50am to get in a queue). ,I cannot make enough positive comments about this experience. Everyone (even the security guards) was terrific and supportive, giving all of us great tips regarding having forms printed/ready in advance, etc. The doors opened at 8.30, and by then there were about 25 of us poor schmucks in line. ,Within 45 minutes, I was through security, upstairs, paid, and sent on my way. I returned at 1pm, and had to wait a bit longer, but all in all it was so easy! ,Tips if you need a passport renewal on the same day: ,1. Make sure you have new passport photos with you,2. Make sure you have filled out (and printed) the proper renewal form online (I would never have known this was needed if I had not first spoken to a facilitator. If you don't have the form, they send you downstairs to do it ---not good!) ,3. Bring all the other items that they include on their list (ie proof of traveling, etc).,4. Be prepared to wait (others had to wait far longer than me),5. Get there super duper early - it's worth it for peace of mind!,6. Bring entertainment (books etc). ,7. Bring a charger for your cell phone or computer (no phone calls allowed;only internet stuff),8. Know that they will accept credit cards. ,9. Go ahead and call in advance to make an appointment, and have the referral number ready (even if the appointment is for days from when you need it - it shows you made an effort),10. Know that your passport must be no less than three months until expiration in order to fly!! ,11. Finally, have a positive attitude if that's possible. I could barely sleep last night for fear that I wouldn't get to Europe for Christmas. There's still no guarantee, but my odds are much better now that I've renewed my passport!,Good luck - and next time, let's put this reminder in our calendars for 10 years from now!"
It wasn't bad.  It is a classic but needs an update in amenities.
"The famous Fenway park, especially when you can see it while driving in and out of Boston. It was a must to stop to check out the park, even if I didn't attend a game. This place is just filled with energy, it's one of the oldest standing baseball park. We walked around the whole park, I was surprised it wasn't bigger. I was able to check out the statues of the famous baseball players in front of the gates and take a picture with them. Also I love the atmosphere the park is surrounding. There many vendors and restaurants in the area, but it's not too modern that it didn't fit with Fenway park. ,All the signs everywhere made me feel the expensive without being inside. since the park wasn't open, we went down to Bleacher Bar that is under the park that had an outfielder view of the park. It was surprise how clean it was for being older than other modern ballparks. Fenway was kept up pretty well with some renovations I noticed. There only two decks, so I assume any seat should be pretty good compare to a bigger modern park like AT&T in the west coast. ,I love that Fenway park still have it's old school charm... Maybe one day I would be able to attend a ball game here"
"Great place to go in hot summer. Open lawns in front are awesome for kids to run and adults to relax. The only big minus is lack of street parking. You have to park in Galeria, cross streets and walk about 5 minutes or so. Else, just majestic."
"This is a great place for a photo opportunity and not much else.  ,It would be a great place to have a picnic.  ,I understand parking is difficult in the area. The best thing to do is park in the Galleria and walk over.  I went around 10:30 am on a Saturday so I had very little trouble.  ,This is more of a visit once every 5 years place unless you really enjoy running water."
"Even tho I'm an Orioles fan, going to a game at Fenway was on my must-list for my first trip to Boston. Truly an amazing ballpark and will definitely be back.  Great to visit one of the oldest parks in baseball. Bucketlist item achieved!"
"Next to the Lincoln Memorial, this is the next must-see place in Washington, DC.  If possible, you should come here just before the sun sets, while it is still visible on the horizon.  The rays of the setting sun shine through the columns and onto the statue of Jefferson.  ,This monument is a long walk away from anywhere else, including the Metro.  If you enjoy walking, then you will enjoy the walk.  If you dont like walking, you might consider getting here by pedicab or taxi.  When you want to leave, a taxi will usually show up within 10 or 15 minutes to discharge a passenger."
Absolutely no comparison that I have ever been to in my life. This park never fails l take my breath away. I have been here for baseball and for a concert. It is definitely a must see if you visit the Boston area.
"This is hands down the best baseball stadium in the United States. Ok, I know I am a bit biased but come on, how can you not love this ballpark? ,The atmosphere here is electric and every seat here is an incredible on. The Citgo sign is a staple in Boston and the Green Monster is a force to be reckoned with. ,Overall, words can't explain how amazing this place is.  You need to come and watch a game yourself! Just be prepared to cook if you are coming on a summer afternoon."
"If you love baseball you must see at least one game at Fenway Park. The history and tradition at this ballpark is remarkable. You can feel the pride Bostonian's have for their city, team, and stadium. Love it!,Had an opportunity to take my parents to the Friday and Saturday games vs. the Angels. We had a wonderful time. The first game we had some drunk 19 year olds seated behind us that made things a little less enjoyable and my Dad does not recommend purchasing the Lobster Roll from the ballpark (yes, he's one of those shmucks). Other than that the weekend was perfect.,If you can afford ""good seats"" do it. Since it's an older park there are bad seats (behind poles, tight spaces, ect.) so make sure you know what you're purchasing! We enjoyed the atmosphere surrounding the stadium and Yawkey Way. Just a great experience."
"Fenway Paaarrrkk is losing out on its last star and I'll mention why a little later. First of all, I'd recommend all baseball fans make a trip to Fenway. The place is very cool. Reminds me of a park me and my friends would build when we were kids. Everyone can relate to making your own field rules. The atmosphere is superb especially when everyone starts singing Sweet Caroline. This moment makes you feel like you're in a movie and part of something special. Here are a couple of reasons I took away the last star. I followed my GPS to the stadium and grabbed the first opportunity to park which was at the Shell Station. This gas station is across the street from the gate, no joke. The downside that they charge you $60. I arrived at 5:30 for a 7:00 game so I got a spot fairly easy. My main disappointment with the park is that it's a cash cow. EVERY beer is conveniently $9 and they expect you to leave the last $1 as a tip. They REALLY almost force you to do this with the peer pressure of laying out a tip plate next to the register. I'm not a fan of all this excessive tipping and here's why I became agitated. I made my way up to the ""Green Monster"" as many fans did and no one was allowed to take pictures unless you had a ticket to enter. They made you stand in a corner ""Green Wall"" and take your pictures from there. You can't even enter before or after the game. So if Fenway Park wants me to give a dollar every time I get a beer they need to let us have access to the ""Green Monster"". Otherwise, it's 5 star entertainment."
"Large gray concrete wall with running water. I do not understand how people are ""so amazed"" by this place. I love Philip Johnson, and the BoA Building is my favorite in Houston, but this water wall is not one of his better works."
Free date spot.  I remember back in high school my girlfriend and I would just come out and talk with the water wall at our backs.  It's beautiful day and night.  The park in front of this is relaxing and it's one of the few tourist spots we have left in this city.  I remember people coming here in limos before prom to take pictures too.  When you come out here it makes you forget for a moment you are in the middle of the city.
"#375,Are you looking for the most ""American"" experience in a city like Boston? Is the temperature greater than 15 degrees Celsius? Do you have a group of friends with you that are very open to watching a sport that has the excitement of cricket or golf, but not as exciting as soccer (football) or basketball? Do you also have at least $45? Well, if you said yes to all of my questions, this experience is as ""American"" as it can get. Baseball is probably one of the most popular sports in the USA, one of the most ""American"" sports in the USA, and this place is one of the oldest baseball fields in the USA.,This place is where the local baseball team, the Boston Red Sox play. They are probably one of the most embarrassing, most despised and most beloved teams in the history of American baseball. They are embarrassing because they actually had a very long history of ""underachieving"", are currently going through a period of mediocrity (as of 2013), and they sometimes make baseball not very exciting to watch. They are despised because they either defeated (or attempted to defeat) your favorite baseball team, make terrible decisions, have too much money, or you simply just don't like them for some other reason. They are beloved because they sometimes make baseball actually exciting to watch, they sometimes have the capabilities to beat the really powerful teams, they actually won a few championships and they even found really cool ways to actually win.,I have been to this place twice. The first time I came here, it was back in 2002 and the Red Sox were playing the Baltimore Orioles. I sat behind the Third Base area. The Red Sox actually won, and the experience was unforgettable. I remember that whenever Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramirez, or Johnny Damon made series of remarkable plays that there was a huge crowd noise that no sound system could ever replicate. There was a lot of passion and drama. A fight actually occurred on the field. The crowd successfully did a ""Mexican wave"". This was what made watching the Red Sox and baseball at this place actually exciting. ,The second time I came here, it was in 2013 and they were playing another ""bird"" team called the Toronto Blue Jays. I sat behind the Right Field area, so it was hard to see the players, but I was in awe to be inside this park again for the first time in 11 years. The Red Sox actually lost but despite this, it was actually cool to see a ""Canadian"" baseball team win and to listen to both ""Oh Canada"" and the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" anthems played. I have a ""soft spot"" for Toronto due to a very personal connection with the city. ,When I walked inside and actually saw the field, I sometimes felt like I was walking into a ""baseball film"". This place definitely has this ""aura"" due to its role in the history of American baseball. Back in 2002, I thought this place was really gritty due to its age and the crowds. When I came back in 2013, it's definitely a little cleaner, retained that ""aura"" and it has some modernization. The food here is obviously expensive. It costs about $12.75 to get a really small and mediocre kielbasa sausage, a bottle of water, and a bag of ""Cracker Jacks"". The location is fairly accessible, but the area can be extremely crowded. ,Overall, if you really want the most ""American"" experience in Boston, watching a baseball game at this place while eating a bag of ""Cracker Jacks"" is actually a pretty good choice. Just hope that the temperature is greater than 15 degrees Celsius and the sky is partly cloudy. If you want to make an amazing baseball film, this is probably one of the finest places to shoot this film. If you are really not interested in baseball but still want to find the most ""American"" experience in Boston, I think you need to think of an alternative, but that might be a little difficult. Although I am not a big fan of baseball, this experience was one of the very few moments I actually had a true ""American"" experience."
I am not a fan of Baseball (always thought they needed a pitch clock like a shot clock) but how can you not love Fenway Park. The feel of the history and the Boston Pride is wonderful. My wife and I decided to go at the last minute while in town for some meetings. So glad we did. Definitely one to cross off the bucket list. BTW hats off to the food vendors in the stands. They worked the stadium none stop the entire game tirelessly.   The hot dog was Great!
"If all government agencies runs as efficient as this office I believe our taxes would become lower automatically.,Making an appointment on the phone was very easy, and I am always on time the line was short about 10 people in front of me and that went very speedily.,I took a book with thinking this was going to be a long day and I wanted to make sure I use my time effectively. after I got my number and told to get a seat. I was existed to continue reading my book where I left off however I barely sat down when they called my number. Walked up to the window the lady took all my paperwork and asked how I plan to pay.,I paid and she said the passport will be mailed out in 3 business days. Done!,That's it, where is my wait time I wanted to read my book.,Keep up the efficiency guys good job. ,Now go over to the DMV and show them how its supposed to be done."
"This was amazing! The parking is a little hard as there is no street parking. We just went into the Galleria's parking structure a short walk away. When you get close enough to the wall, you can feel the mist. There is 11,000 gallons of water running each minute!"
"Saw the Red Sox vs Astros game this weekend. We had EMC2 Suite tickets. So impressed by the Suite, food and bar service. Never seen a game in such Luxury."
"How could you not love this memorial? It's so beautiful! ,The view of the water, even the view of the memorial itself is stunning.,I appreciated the quotes around the statue - Jefferson was truly an amazing man."
"Everyone should visit Fenway at least one time! Baseball at Fenway is different. It is a religious experience for the fans and you can feel this from the crowds 3 blocks away. Everyone has on the Red Sox gear, and they love their team. We took the train in from Providence. It was amazing. At the end of the game they run additional trains so there is little wait time. It was 109 on the field the day we went, and it rained up to start time and still everyone was smiling and laughing. There is a feeling in the park that is infectious. You find yourself drawn into a crowd or store chatting with a local and suddenly you want to be a part of this lovefest! BTW, hot dog is a must. Trust me!"
"Stadium Ranking: #4 out of 30.,   ---   ---   ---,The weird thing about this place ranking #4 is that there are definitely a good amount of negatives with it. The stadiums ranked below do not have nearly the amount of flaws that Fenway has, but this place just has that extra amount of glamour.,This place is everything the Wrigley should be. Kept-up, renovated, and gracefully updated. But that being said, sitting deep into the seats along the baselines is a 1-star experience. The situation is nearly identical to that of Wrigley, in that, the seats are tiny, too close together, and can be obstructed if you're sitting behind a pole. And during the summer, it can be disgustingly stuffy in this area. We were given tickets to this area, and before we moved to different seats, I was wondering why Fenway gets so much love.,But we moved all throughout the venue to check it out from many angles, and ended up lucking out by finding a few empty seats in my favorite area to sit - high home. Fenway is only two decks, so this was a phenomenal vantage point. Once we arrived in these seats, I was wishing that I could freeze time and that the night would never end. To be starring directly at the Green Monster, I felt like a little kid. ,The concourses definitely make you feel like you've gone back in time. The signage, the metal beams, the claustrophobicness of it all - it's really great. ,The video boards are really great. I'm sure that the Red Sox were hesitant to add them for many years, as they attempted to keep the stadium as authentically historic as possible. But I think they did a great job of merging old school with new school. The boards look phenomenal, and the content is great. Bravo, Sox.,We got to sneak up to the Green Monster seats after the game as well - phenomenal. And of course, the area around Fenway is about as good as it gets.,And while there are some extreme flaws with this park, it's to be expected when dealing with a building that was constructed 100 years ago. Sitting high-home at Fenway Park is a total dream come true, and an absolute must for any baseball fan. Just don't sit deep into the lower deck along the baseline, and you'll love the place :)"
"Ok, so this was on my bucket list. As a huge New York Yankees fan I always wanted to go see a Yankee vs. Red Sox game at Fenway. Went this past weekend and all I can say is - ""what a great place..."" I had a blast breaking balls with the Red Sox fans seated around us, and everyone took everything in great stride. ,The seats are tight, it's an old stadium, but it's a great place to see a game. Plenty of great little bars to hit and things to see. ,A word of advice. Use the T line for mass transit. Parking around the stadium bites, but if you have the chance, go. I'm looking forward to my next trip.,GO YANKS!"
"Time for demolition of this relic but owners say no.. I will never return to fenway as the place smells and bathrooms are diguisting. Seats are crammed and to small for anyone other than a 4ft 9 female weighing 110lbs.,Charm is gone for this New Englander."
"Gorgeous sight whether you come during the day or at night. There is free parking available in the garage next to Nordstrom, and it's only a block away. Great place to take a date or out of town visitors, especially if you're already going to be shopping at the Galleria."
"What an historic ballpark!  Not a bad place to go to for my FIRST major league baseball game!  During the game, they close the main street so people can get their beer and food on the street!  The park is kept very clean yet still seemed to have kept that vintage charm.  The seats we were in were cheap at $35 a pop.  They were assigned seats which i think were ""original"" and not changed to something newer because they were tiny!  I know people back in the day were smaller and I'm not a large guy, but a relatively tall on (6'1"").  I was sitting in the back of my seat and my knees were touching the bench in font of me!  Eek!  Our seats looked straight down the first baseline and were covered.  The lighting in the ballpark is great along with the large jumbotron!   ,The food here is so Boston and I love it!  You can get Italian sausage, clam chowder, and lobster rolls here!!!  Also ALL the staff is extremely friendly!  Love it.  Everything is priced accordingly to a ballpark (expensive), but hey, it's nice to have those options.  The common areas are a bit tight, but hey its an older facility!  I think it's the size of people that's more of the problem (hehe).  ,Next time I'm in Boston, I'd love to be back on a warmer day/night!"
"Fenway Park was the #1 ballpark that I wanted to visit before I die.  I'm glad to finally mark it off my bucket list.  It is the oldest ballpark in baseball, where you can feel the history of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio & Lou Gehrig.  They have ALL played on this field, which no other major league ballpark can ever imitate.,Wigley Field is unique, historical & special too; but Fenway Park has the original goofy dimensions that only the old ballparks had, that has been gone long since the way of dodo.  They're also the last stadium to have benches that are still made out of wood!  They're located in the lower deck, underneath the upper deck. No cup holders & no arm rests, so it does feel like you're watching a game back in the 30's.,There have been some major upgrades to this ballpark, such as the new jumbo trons, but it's still neat how they have theirs displays look like the boards from the Green Monster.,As a major baseball fan.., only a baseball fan can truly appreciate the history of attending a baseball game at Fenway Park.  This is the Roman Colosseum of baseball.., and I really enjoyed coming here.  I hope this ballpark will always be the home of the Boston Red Sox."
"Dont even want to rate it 1 star. HAVING the worst experience with Same day, currently.,the people who work there are not helpful, kind of polite.,I paid up the a to have my passport done in 10-14 business days. that was on march 21, it is now today and no passport. ,I am leaving for australia on may 6th but apparently not. ,Rude when I call them and ask for info.,I went to the chicago passport agency and they asked why I went there? everyone asks why. ,if you want more detail, feel free to reply. ,but basically they cant guarantee anything and there is NO refunds. better off going to the CPA."
such a great place to sit and relax...it is a beautiful waterfall. I have been going here for years. Need a break? This the place to go wuuuusawww
"It's Fenway, what else is there to say?! I alwAys hot the Sausage Guy cart on Lansdowne St afterwards."
"Making this available on Yelp to rate is a bit like allowing a mother to rate her child, or a Christian to rate Jesus, or a Deadhead to rate Jerry Garcia, or . . .you get the idea. I'm from Boston, so I freaking love this place. ,Among all the irrational reasons for the Fenway love, there's at least one nugget of logic I can articulate. Fenway is the only park I know of that successfully blends the historical old structure with modern innovations like digital scoreboards that facilitate spectatorship.,Aside from that, I don't care if Fenway has overpriced beer or small seats or too much competition for tickets between the diehards and the post-04 bandwagoneers. I bet you don't care that your kid has big ears."
"Jefferson get the third best spot for a reason. He was the brain trust of American independence. He promoted academic freedom and religious freedom. He was not only the president, but even more importantly to him the father of the University of Virginia. Meanwhile, he was also a slaveholder and a contradictory man."
"If you are a fan of baseball.. this would be a fun to visit to catch a Red Sox game.  The tickets are expensive though.. cheaper than a Patriots game.. but still.  Most tickets can usually bought using StubHub.  I wouldn't buy from the shady shades on the street on the way to the park.  ,Relatively easy to get to... simply off at Kenmore and walk the three blocks to get there.,To be honest, games are really good only when you go with wonderful people.  The place is kept relatively clean.. there is the regular Take Me Out To the Ball Game and Sweet Caroline in Innings 8 and 9.,Everything here costs a lot.. so I would suggest that you get your food fill outside of the stadium.  Beers are about $8.50.  Go for the better stuff.. Harpoon.. forget Bud Lite and Coors Lite.  They used to have delicious corn dogs.. no more.  Don't have high expectations for the food here.. but you'll have a good time."
"MLB Park #10/30,ATMOSPHERE:  I love the streets surrounding Fenway. I felt transported back in time and already that theme of nostalgia hits you as you explore street vendors, restaurants, etc. If you come early, I'd recommend checking out Bleacher bar to get a view of the outfield while grabbing a bite to eat and a drink. ,The first thing we did upon entering the park was head over to the green monster. Unfortunately, the area is corded off to ticket holders so we could only admire from afar. ,The park feels small which eliminates the theme park feeling you can get at some of the newer parks. I still do prefer the city backdrop that Wrigley offers over Fenway. The crowd was great, although we were heavily surrounded by Cubs fans (they do travel well).  We participated in singing 'sweet caroline' (okay I have to admit how much I don't know the words to that song and bum-bum-bum-ed my way through it). ,TICKET PRICING: We knew to buy our tickets early for our trip to Fenway, especially because the Cubs were in town. Our seats were about $40 to sit in the bleachers, which of course was right under the main scoreboard (boo to that view, but I guess you get what you pay for). ,FOOD: The food options in Fenway seem to match the park in the sense they are lacking the cool and upcoming food vendors and stick to the classics--burgers, hot dogs, pizza. We scouted a lobster roll for a not too easy on the wallet price of $13. The lobster roll was okay and definitely on the small side. If you're looking for that amazing Boston lobster roll, probably best to look elsewhere in the city. Then we spotted a Guinness float and I could not pass this up. A chance to get my game beer and ice cream in one. This is exactly the type of thing you want in your hand on a hot July game. We went for an Italian sausage to top off our Fenway eating experience, which for $7.75 wasn't a bad deal.,It's not my favorite park ever, but I'm glad I got to experience Fenway's charm and be a part of its history. Speaking of history, we almost witnessed a no-hitter by Arrieta the night we were here. That would've topped off the experience, but it was fun nonetheless."
"Beautiful park! Highly recommend the walking tour, it gives such a great history of the park and baseball."
"Fenway Park is one of my favorite places on earth. ,I'm a Red Sox fan.,I camped outside Fenway Park overnight to get tickets to the 2005 opening day (ring ceremony for the 2004 World Series Champs).,I've proudly taken my Dad, Grandfather, Grandmother, & Uncle to Red Sox games at Fenway Park.,Yes, the park can be a little cramped - but the newer seats aren't!,I love the ""lyric little bandbox of a ballpark"".,Fenway has somehow managed to upgrade the park but keep the feeling of the original Fenway.,The jumbotron isn't jarring, as it blends in with the walls.,There's a new push this year to be family Friendly - so there's a Red Sox kids fan club (that gives out free tickets) and a Wally's Kids Corner at the park with space for bored young children to run around, color, etc.,I definitely recommend a tour of Fenway Park if you're a baseball fan. The tour guides are knowledgeable and keep the tour interesting.,Come visit & stay for a game!"
"A classic!  Going to a game at Fenway is kind of like stepping back in time (except for the prices on food and drink!).  Compared to larger ballparks like, say Coors Field or Great American, it feels intimate.  You're closer to the action.  They have a guy run out and flip the numbers showing the score on the ""Green Monster"" during breaks in the action - very analog.,12 oz beers are $8.50 - ouch.  It's Boston, though, so what can you do?!  Outfield tickets were $40, too, as opposed to about $12 to see the Rockies.  Of course, there's no comparing those two organizations, really.,Go to Fenway and watch the Sox play!  It's a must!"
"Really, the Transco Fountain that so many Houstonians meet with grimaces, when I mention my love for it. ,I find it the most enchanting spot in Houston, city of great architectural experimentation and great fountains.,Transco Fountain is free, lit up at night, and despite the carnival of families swarming around, creates a sacred space of high falling water in a semi-circle. ,Like being inside the world's largest shower where you can walk up to center, and tune out...Intense relaxation."
History and history in the making. Best baseball experience with the bast fans in the country. Baseball was born here.
I really can't say anything about Fenway that has not been said before but here goes.  I had the incredible pleasure of going to Fenway and watching a game on the 4th of July.  I do not know of anything more American than Baseball and Fenway.  To experience it on the 4th of July at this most fantastic of baseball parks was an incredible experience.  I am In love with this park.
"How can you NOT be in love with Fenway Park?  It has a rich, long history and a wonderful, intimate feel to it.,You can't compare it to the likes of Wrigley Field since they both have their own charm. ,I loved hearing how some of the food sellers with their Boston accents yell out ""Hot dog! Cracker jacks!""  You see the families enjoying the game chowing on hot dogs and pizza and groups of men and women enjoying a beer.,There's also great restaurants/ bars around the area if you wanted a little bit more substance than baseball food.,It was a wonderful September evening and a great way to end the season as the Red Sox roll into postseason."
"Unfortunately, my experience was nothing like any of the reviews.,I spent over 2hours here, almost all of it waiting, through a disastrously long line with a very understaffed office. Never more than 3 windows open, generally 1-2, because everybody was on lunch break. After going through the first line, which took in itself over 30mins, I had to wait in the main line (the one with seating) even longer. On top of that, for some unknown reason you cannot have cellphones nor beverages. Terrible time."
"Referred to as ""America's Most Beloved Ballpark"",I am a baseball fanatic and having the chance visit the oldest stadium in MLB was a dream come true. So much history has been made here! The food and drinks were pricey but that's expected at any ballgame. Also, being that it's an old stadium, everything was pretty outdated but that only gave it a vintage feel to which I adore.,The Red Sox won the night I was there, so I got the chance to see everyone stand up to sing ""Sweet Caroline"" during the 8th inning. The fans were unlike any other, they were all so nice and so incredibly passionate about the game. I don't think I've met people who love baseball more than Bostonians (at least the ones I came across).,If you ever find yourself in Boston during baseball season, this stadium is a must visit!"
"Have you been outside recently? It's Gorgeous!! You can actually sit outside and not sweat! So, how do you take advantage of this beautiful weather? Well, the Galleria can be a tough place to drive and find parking, but my husband works in Williams (Transco) tower, so we occasionally go there.  It's a great place to take your lunch, sit, eat, and enjoy the Waterwall. I LOVE water and I find the Waterwall to be very soothing. Sometimes the water is turned off and that can be disappointing. Also, when there are a ton of people there to take photos for their quinceanera it can be a bit annoying, but I can see why they'd pick this park and the Waterwall as a backdrop.  ,If you haven't been there, go at least once.  Park in the Nordstrom parking garage and walk across."
"A memorial to the 3rd president Thomas Jefferson that was well designed by the famed architect John Russell Pope who also designed the National Gallery of Art. From the top of the steps facing the Tidal Basin there is a scenic view looking northeast towards the US Capital building. Rangers are friendly, helpful and informative.,architect,th"
"I didn't go to the baseball park, but stumbled on WWII Victory Gardens.  Very quaint and still cultivated by local residents."
"While I did not enjoy a Red Sox game here, I did enjoy a Tom petty concert. The stadium is set up perfectly so you have a good view from any seat. Concessions were readily available (although the beer line was way,way long) and bathrooms were (surprisingly) never crowded. And the great part was it is easily accessible by the T so no need to wait in traffic after an event. Can't wait to return in the summer for the Red Sox!"
"It's Fenway, what else do you really need to say?,History, aura, greatness, and magic all rolled up into one great baseball park. If you're in town, even if it's the off season, please do yourself a favor and take a tour of this amazing piece of baseball and Boston history. Better yet, catch a game here! You'll have one less thing to cross off your bucket list."
"What can I say about Fenway Park that no one has before? As a baseball fanatic I loved the history and traditions it carries. Small but you feel right at home, I went to the Red Sox vs Yankee game with my boyfriend and even though he had his Yankee jacket and hat on we didnt get yelled or cursed at by Red Sox fans. In fact they were very nice and great to watch the game with. The couple next to us explained the neighborhood the ballpark and things to see in Boston. We found out that they have a bar by the Green Monster closer to the center field called Bleacher Bar, I am definitely going to go there next time I go to Fenway."
So much nostalgia and Red Sox history is involved with this ball park! I'm extremely happy that they chose to renovate Fenway instead of replacing it with some new flashy stadium. This venue is a must visit for any baseball fan! The ticket prices are a little higher than most parks but it's absolutely worth it.
"A must-see Houston landmark, especially for visitors.  Frequently, in warm weather, you will see high schoolers dressed up for prom or quinceaneras and, of course, tourists snapping photos.  People picnic and play frisbee or bring their dogs.  There are plenty of benches on which to park your bottom and relax and enjoy the scenery and people-watching.  I had a first date here in high school that was an awkward episode, but most memories are happy!"
"A true legend. International tourists need to download the lyrics to ""Sweet Caroline"" and the 7th-inning stretch song ""Take me out to the ballgame"" and there is nothing in the way of a truly Bostonian experience at Fenway!"
"Where it began,,I can't begin to knowin',-----------------------------------------,It began on Yawkey way, with me giving my little brother red sox tickets for his college graduation! Justin U. obviously came along, salivating over the chance to visit one of the oldest, most historic sports arenas in the United States!,-----------------------------------------,But then I know it's growing strong,Was in the spring,And spring became the summer,Who'd have believed you'd come along.,-----------------------------------------,The best spring gift for me was the 2004 world series win of the Red Sox while I was in college in Boston... the memories just come crowding in!  No I'm older, wiser and living in Hawai'i. Coming back to that green monster, was an integral part of coming back to Boston!,-----------------------------------------,Hands, touchin' hands,Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you,Sweet Caroline,Good times never seemed so good,I've been inclined,To believe they never would,But now I, look at the night,And it don't seem so lonely,We fill it up with only two.,-----------------------------------------,Those $8 beers never seemed so good either... We nomed on everything from hot dogs to clam chowder and pizza to big soft doughy pretzels.  Yeah, the prices are inflated but it's all part of the charm of being in a historic sports venue.  And sang Sweet Caroline at the top of our lungs!,-----------------------------------------,And when I hurt,,Hurtin' runs off my shoulders,How can I hurt when I'm with you,Warm, touchin' warm,Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you,-----------------------------------------,We went to the Red Sox on Mothers Day and the Fenway staff was giving out ""Support Boston"" stickers, red sox bracelets and collectors cards.  The phrase ""Ah you a Mothah?"" echoing throughout the stands was just priceless..... ,-----------------------------------------,Sweet Caroline,Good times never seemed so good,-----------------------------------------,Even though the Red Sox lost the Game we went to, we had a great afternoon and it was well worth the ticket and food prices! Can't wait to come back!"
"Great park, a lot of food options, beautifully kept.  I was a bit spoiled with the view in San Francisco since we were there often due to us living next to it, so the water and view from that park is something that is hard to beat.  But I do really enjoy this stadium, especially the home plate pavilion and the seats within that group.  We went to Football at Fenway last night and sat in field box 13, row E, and it was fantastic too.  Love walking into this stadium, with Yawkey ally and the fun areas around the stadium by entrances."
"To get through the confusing and content-laden phone menu:,There are a million options in the phone menu, so to get through to  the automated appointment menu use the touch-tone combination 1(english) then 2(automated appointment system) then 1(traveling in next 14 days) then 1(new appointment) at each new menu.  I found the extreme amount of information on this service made it difficult to find your selection."
"I have to come back for a game.,Was in Boston for only a few hours, and had to come to Fenway! It's been a dream to stand by the Green Monster!!,Finally made it happen. Easy parking on the street (not a game day) and fun bar by the field. Walked in and a red head Boston native said ""you're beautiful"" to me in that wonderful accent. Made my day!!,Can't wait to come back!"
Beautiful sunny day for a Fall wall waterfall...think about it
My favorite place of all the things we saw in DC
"Historic monuments = have to give a 5/5 on yelp!,Awesome place in DC!  There is a lot of history with the Thomas Jefferson statue himself.  ,Across from the view, there is a beautiful river, and that's a really good place for picture opportunities!  I really enjoyed the peacefulness of this location even though there were so many tourists during Spring Break.  T'was a good stop to come by."
"Another baseball stadium review in honor of opening week. ,Yep, Fenway is wicked awesome. ,It's one of the two old ballparks left and man, if they tear this one or Wrigley down, I predict riots in the streets. They're both beautiful in their own respects, but this review is about Fenway! ,Like many have said, Fenway is an experience. Getting into the field, you walk down Yawkey Way, chock full of bars, concession stands and of course, souvenir shops. Stop into one of the bars, people watch and have a drink- you'll be glad you did- the people watching is second to none. The excitement for game time just seems to radiate off of people (or is that the beer?),Once inside, you're greeted by history. the Green Monster, the manual scoreboard, Sweet Caroline, obligatory 'Yankees Suck' shirts (regardless of who the Sox are playing) and Boston character. Basically, there's nothing that sucks about this experience and there's not a bad seat in the house. If you get the opportunity to go, don't turn it down."
"America's Favorite Past-time in one of America's oldest ballparks?  YES PLEASE!!  Whether you're a fan of the Redsox or not, Fenway Park is a place that every baseball fan MUST experience.,To see the Green Monster, Pesky's Pole, seeing the red painted seat from Ted Williams' 502 ft homerun - Fenway isn't just about the Redsox, it's about the history of baseball.  It's mixing the new era (Green Monster seats, etc.) with the old.  It's about the peanuts and cracker jacks.  Indulging in a Fenway Frank while  the guy next to you starts a ""Yankees Suck"" chant.  ,Yes, I know what Heaven looks like... and it's called Fenway Park."
"This is a must do for anyone coming into Boston during baseball season.  The ballpark is the oldest stadium in any professional sports in the U.S. and for that reason a park of history.  Not sure how much longer the city of Boston is going to keep the ballpark before they finally decide to either remodel it or build a brand new one and tear down Fenway.  Not sure if it will ever happen, but just in case you should plan a trip here and take in a game.  ,Walking through the gates you can already feel the history there and flashbacks of people from the 1900's walking through the halls come flooding into by mind.  Bostonian fans are great to hang around and when the Red Sox wins makes the game that much more exciting and fun.  ,I personally hope they never tear the ballpark down, but we all know someday it will be rebuilt, the question is when."
"LOVED my Fenway experience (though the fact that I witnessed an awesome game may have something to do with that.) ,I love the atmosphere inside and outside around the park. Really appreciated that row 31 in Bleacher 42 still left me saying ""these are good seats"". The old time feel of the park (all over - concession stands, manual scoreboard) mixed really well with the new technology (LOVE the new scoreboard over center field) and the iconic Fenway Green Monster. ,Since we lost our team way back, I haven't really had ""a team"", but I suddenly find myself excited for the Red Sox. My 2-year old had a blast too, and she stayed until the end of the 8-7 walk-off victory. WHAT A GAME!!! Wow.,(Special thanks to the Fan Services table outside bleacher 43 for holding onto my stroller for the game and for providing stickers and pins to my daughter. Really put her in the mood for the game.)"
"How often do you get to see a wall?  With water running down it?  Pretty often.  But this, this is your regular leak on a wall transformed into a symbol of peace, love, hope, beauty, idealism, and HOUSTON.  It's been here since the beginning of time, 274 BC to give you a more precise date.  I show it to all visitors that come to Houston along with the Transco tower.  Yea!"
"I took the tour in October 2012 right after the horrible season. I made a vow to come back and see the team the following season. ""Oh why waste your money when they suck"" people told me but yeah I knew something good was going to happen that 2013 season. And for the first time ever I was right. ,I came for the Sox v. Skankees series (Sept 2013) and had the time of my life. It's official; this has to be my most favorite place in the world. I'm from Chicago and people talk about how wonderful Wrigley Field is. It does not even hold a candle to the awesomeness of Fenway.,I love that Yawkey Way is shut down on game day. Vendors outside hawking programs, food and shirts. Everyone is having a great time. Sure beats playing bags and grilling in a parking lot. ,This is just one of those places that you can feel the spirit of baseball. If you're a baseball fan, you know what I mean. I didn't want to be a typical tourist but when I started walking around inside, I couldn't help but stop and look at everything. I'll admit it, I might have even sported some tears in the stands; yes, this place is that magnificent.  Our seats were great (two rows above the famous Ted Williams red seat) and offered an excellent view of the field. ,I would probably pass on going to guest services for a ""my first visit"" type deal (I'm currently on a 30 MLB park bucket list kick). Usually you get a certificate commemorating the visit from other parks, here you got a Wally sticker. Yeah big wahhh-waah.,The one downside was the lobster roll. I heard great things but it just didn't hold up. Yeah I definitely have a Fenway Frank next time. ,Like I said, I love this place and I'm jealous that people of Boston get to experience it every game day. Can't wait to schedule my next trip and hit up another game."
"I recently had to get an updated passport for travel within the next 2 weeks. Although the line was fairly long, everyone was incredibly helpful and polite. They listened to any concerns I had and guided me the right way. I'm so lucky I have an agency this close to where I live. Great job!"
This was one of the first ballparks I visited outside of my hometown of Chicago. I saw the Red Sox play the Angles here back in '03 and what a great memory it was. Such a historic ballpark with a lot of great memories and history here. Was very glad to say that I was able to catch a game here(before they allowed seating in the left field wall).
"I thought I'd seen the water wall. I mean, I drive by it all the time when going to the Galleria Mall. But I'd never actually walked over to the little park it's in, and I was missing out! ,With my parents (who were visiting Houston for the first time), J and I got sorbetto/gelato at the mall, and then walked down and across the grass to check this place out. And we were really glad we did, as all four of us loved staring up at the water wall from inside it. It's really different to gaze up at it from up close, and to get a sense of vertigo from so much water falling so hard. The sound it makes is just about the perfect white noise, too, and when you're nearby you can just about drown out the sounds of Houston. The lights create a really nice ambiance as the sun sets, and I declared the excursion a success when my parents actually took photographs. ,Everyone walked all around it, inside and out very slowly. Then we stood in the arches looking out over what really is a lovely esplanade. What a nice little park- how did I never notice it there? The temperature was just perfect for a stroll. ,We were there during prom time, so people were pulling up in limos to take photos as well. We saw some seriously weird prom outfits, and well.... mostly flashy and skimpy outfits, nothing I was that fond of. Kids today, I tell ye! They don't know what class is! It ain't a prom dress halfway up your thighs, I can tell ya' that much.,Anyway, next time you're at the mall, particularly if the sun is setting, wander on over here and sit with a beverage, or a friend, or a date.  The grass is mighty well kept."
"The Jefferson Memorial is a wonderful tribute to a spectacularly unique and tremendous man.  Each and every member of our elected government should be force-fed Jeffersonian Democratic Principles 101.  Or at the very least, brought here on a group tour of this Memorial.,The 19 ft bronze statue stands with purpose and is surrounded by some of his many profound and wonderful writings.  My last visit to Mr. Jefferson was spent reading, with an almost religious focus, the quotes and excerpts from his prolific catalog.  The memorial isn't just what is seen on the main level, though.  There is a basement level with more to see, read, and learn.  ,There is also a gift shop down there.  PRO TIP: Buy something and pay in cash and if your change is more than $2, they'll give it to you in $2 bills.  Jefferson, for those who don't know, is on the $2 bill.,I hope your visit to this serene and beautiful tribute to one of the greatest leaders known to all mankind will spur your interest in him.  You probably didn't know that Thomas Jefferson wrote roughly 19,000 letters in his lifetime.  There are many genius things he had to say for us to discover."
"Fenway Park is undoubtedly, the cathedral of Boston. There is so much history here, and this place is a must-visit for any fan of the game. Having been to Boston plenty of times, but never to visit this ballpark, I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. ,Let's start with the sights to see here. Yawkey Way, an alleyway where on one side houses the Red Sox Clubhouse Store and on the other, an assortment of food venues. It's open before the game and a must-visit spot for newcomers and regulars alike. There's Lansdowne Garage, the parking area situated behind the Green Monster where more than a few cars have been dented by long fly balls. And finally, there's the infamous Green Monster and the Pesky Pole. I'd advise getting to the ballpark early just to be able to get a view of the field from there. ,The ballpark was a lot smaller than I imagined, but this provided for a very intimate atmosphere. For a warm summer Wednesday evening, the stadium was packed to almost full capacity (a shade under 38,000). The fact that they were playing the San Diego Padres and the place was almost full shows to the testament of Red Sox Nation. I felt the energy of the crowd throughout the game, and especially during the 8th-inning ""stretch"" of Sweet Caroline. ,Unfortunately, Fenway Park is far from perfect. There are steel pillars on the infield grandstands that can obstruct your view of the field should you decide to sit in those sections. The seats are small and the aisles are cramped. The food is tolerable at best. Tickets are pricier than most other ballparks. ,Despite all this, I still had a great experience, and Fenway was everything I expected out of a ballpark with such rich history. This is a fantastic place that everyone should visit, especially more so for any true fans of the game."
"Let's set the record straight. For the most part, I'm a fan of baseball. Strangely, my favorite teams are Dodgers, BoSox, Yankees, Rangers, and Indians (in that order)...but I would have to say that I am a lover of the game in general.,Having been to a number of ballparks, both modern and classic over the years, I have to say that Fenway Park tops my list. Yes, watching a game at Fenway is even more enjoyable, entertaining, and highly more intimate than even old Yankee Stadium!,I love the fact that BoSox fans are so incredibly faithful to their team, arriving at the ballpark on time even in the thick of traffic. This is a stark contrast to what I'm accustomed to at my beloved Dodger Stadium where 'fans' stroll in at a leisurely pace into the 3rd inning.,What I believe contributes to the intimacy and energy felt at Fenway is the fantastic landscape view of the entire field from nearly all seats (excluding seats behind steel I-beams which create sore blind spots). You literally feel like you're in on all the action. For lack of a better description, it's sorta like watching a Major League game at a Minor League park with all the niceties.,Concession stands at Fenway offer a classic selection of hot dogs (Fenway Franks), sausages, pizza, beverages, and etc at prices you'd expect to pay at sporting venues. Each stand I waited in moved rapidly thanks to efficient concession stand employees.,I can't comment on the parking situation here at Fenway as we had no issue finding street parking less than a mile away.,So if you're like I was, a Red Sox fan who has never been to Fenway or just a lover of the game, you MUST make the trek here. I guarantee, you will fall in love with this place. Who knows, you might become absorbed into the Red Sox Nation! ;)"
Northing says home when you are at the sox game. I was privilege enough to go to my first game at 22 last year! Still dream about it today!
Yes I know it was built over 100 years ago and yes it's probably nostalgia talking BUT Fenway Park will always be one of the best places to see a baseball game any era. It is a FAR cry from the Fenway Park I grew up with (my first game being in the 70's) it is night and day difference. Nicely done John Henry ownership group kudos. The downside to all this progress is the prices (for EVERYTHING) are outrageous!! They really should be embarrassed by the prices they charge. Good news is everyone I've ever dealt with at or to do with Fenway have been great. So with all that being said Fenway Park is a must stop on any baseball/sports or history fan.
"I was excited to finally visit the famed Fenway Park while in Boston. It was almost a week after the horrible marathon bombing and the city was taking it initial steps at getting back to normal. So a chilly, but sunny afternoon watching the Sawx battle the Royals was in order.,First off, if you can take the train, do it because parking is an absolute nightmare around the stadium. If/when you do find a spot, you'll easily shell out a couple of twenties to almost any and every business (including Burger King) in the immediate area willing to lighten your wallet. At least my game ticket was cheaper...I guess.,Entering into and first seeing the ball park from behind home plate was a cool experience. The game was already underway and seeing the players on the field and the Green Monster in the distance is something everyone should experience at least once. ,I found my way to my seat in the Infield Grandstand along first base and was immediately bummed. The seats, if you can call them that, were more like a slatted park bench with metal armrests in between. Not horrible, but certainly far from comfortable. Then there was the view, or lack thereof, of the field, which was like involuntarily watching a letterbox, widescreen version of the game. That is, if you could see around the tall, green posts supporting the overhead pavilion. Made for a cool picture though.,Okay, so I admittedly did a horrible job at researching the best seats and the cheap price of my ticket finally made my overhead lightbulb go off. But I get it...it's America's oldest MLB ballpark and they're not changing it. I realize we're all spoiled by the new stadiums nowadays with nice seats, cup holders and pristine views of the field. But Fenway is about history, nostalgia and all that, which is why I was here to begin with.,Of course, that didn't necessarily stop me from walking up to the overhead pavilion after only one inning and grabbing an empty seat to watch the rest of the game. There was a much better view and the sun felt great. If you're a baseball fan, history fan or both, Fenway should be on your bucket list. And if not, go anyway."
"This is an amazing piece of working art, the water actually looks like a waterfall due to the design of grooves in the wall as the water trickles down. Watch out on a windy day, because you will get wet. The park adjacent from the Water Wall  is very nice. The easiest way to find this structure is look for the Williams Tower (the tallest, dark blue glass building in the Uptown/Galleria area. (I recreated a yelp profile for this because it was mis-named compared it what it is called in tourist/info guides)"
"10 weeks and counting for a first time passport. Every time I call I am told it is ""in process"". A coworker applied after me and got his within 2 weeks. So I guess the dice didn't roll my way. I was planning on going on a cruise to the Caribbean for my honeymoon, but I guess I am staying in the U.S., or at least the territory. Government run, and it shows. It is a ""business"" that can afford to have no customer service, as they hold the power.  If your first time passport goes to them, I hope you get luckier than me. Most incompetent business I have ever experienced."
"Greatest park I have ever been to.  This old staple in baseball history is old and shows it's age at times,  but the history and lore of this stadium is breath taking.  Or seats were not bad but we had a little bit of an obstruction in our view.  Small price to pay for this historic moment."
"Totally cute, totally romantic, and totally scored me one of the best first kisses up to date."
"Thomas Jefferson is one of my favorite presidents so visiting him is always a special experience.  I regrettably did not have time to go to Monticello in Charlottesville.  If you're staying in DC, say the Foggy Bottom District or near Farragut Square, Scott Circle, or Dupont Circle, and if you're a runner, it's a nice 5 mile run if you go down 16th St towards the White House, around the White House and then around the Washington Monument and you'll see the Jefferson Memorial.  Simply run around the water until you get there and run back and you'll have it logged in.,Tip: Get there early, say before 8:30am.  The morning light is much prettier on structures like this.  By noon, the light will wash out everything and you'll get boring shots.  With the sunset or sunrise, you'll get dramatic shadows that make for wonderful photography.,If you climb the stairs, there's an impressive statue of Thomas Jefferson along with a long passage that comes from his most important quote, that begins with, ""We hold the truth to be self-evident that all men are created equal...."",A very inspirational monument that makes one proud to be American and gives light to foreigners about the heart of what being an American is about."
"I'm a Yankee fan. I've been to the old and new Yankee Stadium, but upon walking out on the 1st base side of Fenway, it was jaw dropping as it probably was on the first time I walked out of the old Yankee Stadium.,On a recent trip to Cape Cod I got lucky enough to get a free ticket behind home plate from a friends fiancee. Only thing I had to pay for was beer and a sausage sandwich for the both of us. Done. Beer was flowing, sausage sandwiches were gobbled up. Great day.,A place where every baseball fan needs to go. Not many of these old stadiums are left, so you have to make it to them when you can."
We were visiting from Cleveland for the purpose of going to Fenway. We loved it! The historical spots they have around the stadium were great. Concession prices were reasonable. They give a great fan experience. Cabs and Uber drivers are plentiful and easy to find in the area. Fenway is now tied with Wrigley as my husband's favorite ballparks in the nation!
"Ah, Fenway. You may be small, but you are mighty. Your history, your spirit, your beer selection... There isn't a whole lot NOT to love about you except, of course, for the pain-in-the-ass parking. ,For a ballpark as old and beloved as this one, I am so impressed with the updated and well-oiled operations. It's easy to deal with the ticketing agents, go through security, get in, find your seat, and from you seat to find food, the restroom, beverages, etc. Really, there isn't a bad seat in the house, either. It's just all so fun.,With all the modern amenities implemented, I am so happy Fenway hasn't lost its old-school charm. The crowd's the same -- rowdy, passionate and in-the-moment -- and I love that when you're in Fenway, there is this sense of immense fun and togetherness. A word to the wise: do the wave. They'll just keep doing it and boo you if you don't, so just do it!,Also, be sure to show up a bit early for your game. It's really quite something to gather outside the gates, get a frank from the vendors and wait with the crowd (and also, these franks are far superior to the ones sold inside, so I recommend filling up here!)."
History Lives. Club level. Heaven......Batter uppp!!!
"I would have given 5 stars, but due to the rude behavior  from the man who verified my application at the front desk, i would rate this agency with 3-star,But we had a nice experience with the lady who processed my son's passport, she was polite and sounded knowledgeable. Since we came all the way from Wisconsin, she said i will get the passport within 4 hrs. It was wonderful. Really appreciate the professionalism.,The man with shaved head at the front desk behaved unruly. I took my cell phone to view the confirmation number, agree the fact that i made a mistake. But he was so furious and started cursing me ;like 'he will throw me out if i touch the cell phone"" .  I didn't say a word, and i wasn't sure why he was so furious. In my opinion, he was not a professional, and sounded loutish."
"Came here for the first time to watch Red Sox-Yankees final game of the 2014 season. I traveled from New Jersey to come watch Derek Jeter play his final game of his baseball career. So did 20,000 other Yankee/Jeter fans. There were definitely more Yankee shirts than Sox shirts. The park was filled with energy and respect due to the occasion. This was probably the last time Yankee fans would be welcome at Fenway lol. Anyway, I had an amazing time. Fenway is much smaller compared to say Yankee stadium, which is the only other baseball park I've been to. It's smaller and older but I loved the atmosphere and feel in there. It's what a baseball park should be like. Definitely a good memory. Would love to come back for another game...without my Yankee apparel on lol."
"I love this park. We visited during my first trip to Houston (my other half is from here, I'm originally from Oregon) and now since moving here I can say I got engaged right on the front steps of the fountain surrounded by a park full of strangers! It was amazing and romantic and I'll remember it forever. :)"
"I was in Boston for a couple of days with work, and Fenway was at the top of my free-time to do list. ,Born and raised Rockies fan (well, I was 2 when the Rox came into existence, but close enough), and despite the painful memories of '07, the Red Sox have always sort of been my American League team, couple that with Fenway being, well, Fenway, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to watch a game at one of the most beautiful and historic parks in the league. ,I had just been to Coors Field in Denver for a Rox game about 24 hours before the Sox game, so the comparisons between a relatively new (80+ years younger) and much larger (second biggest in the MLB) Coors and comparatively ancient and tiny Fenway definitely stuck out, but it didn't in any way change the majesty that I saw in Fenway. ,It starts before you even get into the park. The atmosphere was unreal. Red Sox everything, everywhere. It felt like a huge party. Inside, fans were crazy (in a good way) which was awesome to see, considering the garbage season the Sox are having. The Green Monster. The huge Citgo sign. That 2007 Championship flag that still haunts my dreams. ,It definitely shows its age, but I think that comes out in the most incredible way possible. It feels like you step back into time when you step into Fenway. ,Coors Field might have cheaper tickets, more concessions, seats that you can comfortably fit into and the Rockies, but Fenway has, by far, the best experience in baseball. Even if the team on the field leaves something to be desired."
"Ugh, when was this place built? Like, 1912?,I've gotta say though, five stars for the team that the front office decided to put onto the field. This may be my ignorance of the game speaking, but I think it must be some kind of tradition to field a squad of circus freaks to sell tickets and amuse the fans when the team isn't doing too well. Let's see, the guy throwing the ball, the hurler, I guess, was some kind of ill-tempered humanzee. I guess one of Tom Thumb's kin was at second. They even had a fat man! He wouldn't play in the field but he would only come up to swing a balls. I think I saw one of his old sideshow routines when he would swing his bat at a telephone.,Those guys in the orange, though? I think they were from Baltimore? Class acts, all the way.,But seriously folks...,(Those that decry or are unable to grasp the spiritual element of baseball need not read on. That means you, Joe Buck.),You can look at ballparks like cathedrals.,(Actually, maybe you should stop reading too, Pope Francis.),Ahem. Many can look at ballparks like cathedrals, or any place of worship for that matter. Not to encourage idolatry or anything but for all of the stress that's put on numbers and performance, for all of the money and expectations, for all of the bickering in the front office, the fights on the field and dugout, for all of the scandals, the heartbreak, the injuries, the steroids, the hours upon hours of mind-numbing repetition, not just within baseball but within your own life, there exists a kind of peace in the stands. Every time you find yourself doubting such a peace exists you can feel it gently wash over you the moment you emerge from the cold steel and concrete corridors to see the grass laid before you. It's a like an Earthly glimpse of the Elysian plain.,I wanted to hate this place and, arriving in head-to-toe Orioles gear, thought that the feelings of hatred would be reciprocated by others in the stands. Yet, by the top of the second, we were talking with Red Sox fans, other O's fans and folks who were just there to enjoy this beautiful game in this iconic stadium."
"I visited on a rainy, non-game day.  Still, this is a great ballpark and a must-see.  We missed the guided tour but went in all the shops and areas we could.  Fenway is an American Institution and all yall should go see it."

"Really?? I made an appointment by calling the toll free number. I had an 8:30 appointment. I got to the Federal Building and waited in the lobby until 8:25 when I finally got thru security. Up to the 18th floor where I stood in another line! We all walked in and stood in another line. Everyone before me did NOT have an appointment and were processed before me. So what is the use of calling to arrange an appointment? I was also the ONLY one to have ALL of my paperwork in order. Not too hard to follow instructions. Since I'm not traveling until next week, I get my passport in another 2 days. I was hoping I could pick it up later today, no luck. Oh, whatever you do, do NOT ask the security in the building or on the floor a question. They look at you as though they do NOT want to be bothered. I get it, it is a Federal building but lighten up Francis!"
"I'm a diehard Phillies fan, but I could care less.  You go to Boston, you see Fenway as a pure baseball fan.  Allegiances aside, this place is absolutely amazing.,Went on a tour during March.  Sitting on top of the Green Monster was a real treat, and being able to touch history with every step gives a true baseball fan goosebumps.,Just as a fan of the game of baseball, drop by and see Fenway.  Worth every penny."
Massive variety of food choices and it isn't as expensive as Wrigley Field for food. Not too shabby
"Bar to the left,  Bar to the right , everywhere you turn...so awesome!!!! Had a really good ball park  experience during the visit."
"Went to Fenway for a game once, won't be back.,Way too old of a stadium, seating doesn't work if you're of average height by today's standards, chairs much too small.  There were pillars and other obstructions blocking the view of the field in many seats.  The food and drink workers are some of the rudest I've ever encountered.  ,Oh, and the Sox got crushed that game. ,Time to tear this dinosaur down and build something modern where patrons can come and actually enjoy the game."
"I booked my trip overseas a little over a month ago.  First time out of the country.  Needed a passport but after reading everything I could on the govt passport site, didn't want to chance it with going through normal process and expediting service through the mail.  Would cut it too close.  So I decided to wait for the 2 week window and I'm glad I did. ,I made my appt last Sunday, actually the day before my ""official"" 2 weeks thinking I'd get something that week, but the first available was this week, 6 days before my flight.  I wondered if my procrastination was cutting it too close.  ,Got down to the fed bldg at 9:40 for my 10am appt.  Sec guard on 18th floor said to wait in the line in the hall which wasn't that long (my drivers license line - now that was a long line).   Maybe 10 people.  Yeah you gotta turn off your phone and take batteries out of cameras and what not - but thats fine.  And yeah they aren't the nicest people - but they get asked a LOT of stupid questions - I'd be a bit snarky too.  Makes me wonder if people do any research about passports before going down there. ,Was out of the outside before 10am and waited in the first inside line maybe 10 min.  Gave the first person my confirmation number and he verified I had all the required info.  Got my number and then sat down in another waiting area.  There were about 20 people in front of me and I think I waited there about 20 min or so.  ,My number was called and I gave the woman my docs and she reviewed them and I was done in less than 5 min.   Since I had 6 days till my trip she said I had ""plenty of time"" and said I could pick up my passport tomorrow.  Works for me.  It was $160 which included the normal passport book fee and expedited service.  ,For a govt agency and process - this was really smooth and the people were pleasant.  Of course I still need to pick up the passport tomorrow.  Will update if there are problems there."
"I needed my kids passports renewed the same day.  You need to get there early.  Was in line by 7:30.  Had my paperwork blessed by 9.  Picked up my passports by 2 pm.  As long as you have all your paperwork in order and show them your travel requirements it is no problem.  I might have given them 5 stars except for the overzealous security guard who needed everyone to ""respect his authority""  I think he just liked to yell at people."
"Okay, I planned to spend and entire afternoon getting a new passport as the tweaker who stole my purse accidentally ended up with my beloved passport too....I went in armed and ready for battle with 2 identical 2x2 inch hideous photographs, a copy of my birth certificate, proof of travel with in 48 hours and all downloaded and properly filled out applications.,So at 2:23pm  I park my car at 55 E.  Jackson.  Get hideous photo taken, walk across the street to 230 S. Dearborn, clear security, head to the 18th floor.  Present documents, given number.  Number called, present documents again. Pay $160 (135 plus expedite fee).  Told to be back by 4pm.  Helpful, kind clerk did not remark my horrific photo or battered birth certificate.  She did not lecture me on the ""poor planning on your part"" theory.  She simply helped me.  She did not have a bad attitude or hate her job, she laughed and joked with me and remarked on the beauty of my previous passport photos.  She shared a few war stories about people stranded in Chicago because of expired passports, sent from the airport upon arrival when documents are discovered expired, tampered with or lost.  She was a goverment employee that was kind and helpful and patient. WOW!!!!!!,I hate waiting in cramped rooms so I went down to the farmer's market on the plaza, walked around the block, grabbed a quick lunch and headed back up to the 18th floor. Tendered my receipt and with in minutes, received a new 10 year passport.  ,Walked back to the parking garage and got my car out at 3:34pm.  An hour and some change for a new decade of crossing borders without hinderence.  Priceless!,Here is an important note, if you need an emergecy passport (traveling with in 48 hours) Chicago is one of the few cities that take walk-ins at their facility.  If it is a two week ""emergency"" you have to schedule an appointment."
